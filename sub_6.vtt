WEBVTT

01:22.749 --> 01:24.375
The forests of Pandora

01:25.168 --> 01:26.586
hold many dangers.

01:33.510 --> 01:34.761
But the most dangerous thing

01:34.928 --> 01:35.929
about Pandora...

01:40.558 --> 01:42.811
is that you may grow
to love her too much.

01:55.824 --> 01:57.784
We sing the songcords
to remember.

01:58.827 --> 01:59.828
Each bead,

02:00.537 --> 02:01.538
a story
in our life.

02:03.915 --> 02:05.667
A bead for the birth
of our son.

02:10.797 --> 02:12.507
Neteyam!

02:12.590 --> 02:13.758
Neteyam!

02:20.723 --> 02:21.724
A bead

02:21.850 --> 02:24.060
when we adopted
our daughter, Kiri.

02:25.728 --> 02:27.188
Born of Grace's avatar.

02:28.439 --> 02:30.650
A daughter whose conception
was a total mystery.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.166
A bead

02:46.291 --> 02:47.625
for the first communion
with Eywa.

02:51.671 --> 02:53.131
The People say

02:53.256 --> 02:54.257
we live
in Eywa...

02:56.050 --> 02:57.886
...and Eywa
lives in us.

03:00.805 --> 03:02.265
The Great Mother

03:02.390 --> 03:03.600
holds all her children

03:03.683 --> 03:04.851
in her heart.

03:13.818 --> 03:14.944
Happiness is simple.

03:17.280 --> 03:18.448
But who would've thought
a jarhead like me

03:18.531 --> 03:19.532
could crack the code?

03:23.536 --> 03:25.663
When I first met your father...

03:26.206 --> 03:27.498
...I was trying to kill him.

03:27.874 --> 03:29.000
It was love at first sight.

03:30.168 --> 03:31.628
Before I knew it, we had four.

03:35.924 --> 03:37.967
When we sent the Sky People
back to Earth,

03:38.134 --> 03:39.594
a few of 'em stayed.

03:40.261 --> 03:42.138
Science guys,
loyal to the Na'vi.

03:43.973 --> 03:44.974
And then there was Spider.

03:45.058 --> 03:46.100
-Spider, Spider...
-Spider!

03:46.184 --> 03:47.310
He was just stuck here.

03:47.393 --> 03:48.978
Too young
for a cryo-capsule.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.813
You little wild man.

03:50.897 --> 03:51.898
See you, Norm!

03:51.981 --> 03:53.733
Orphaned by the war,
he was raised by the lab guys.

03:53.816 --> 03:54.859
Spider, take
your spare!

03:54.984 --> 03:56.402
I'm just going
to the village!

03:57.946 --> 03:59.530
He wasn't
part of our family.

03:59.697 --> 04:00.949
He was like a stray cat.

04:01.115 --> 04:02.116
Just always around.

04:03.868 --> 04:05.578
Inseparable
from our kids.

04:09.540 --> 04:10.750
To Neytiri,

04:10.917 --> 04:12.210
he would
always be alien.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.087
One of them.

04:14.629 --> 04:17.090
He belongs with his own kind.

04:21.511 --> 04:22.595
It's mine!

04:22.804 --> 04:23.805
I had it first.

04:24.222 --> 04:25.682
Why should I let you have it?

04:25.765 --> 04:27.141
Took a few
years to get the language

04:27.225 --> 04:28.268
through my thick skull.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.395
But now when I hear it,

04:30.478 --> 04:31.562
it might as well be English.

04:32.021 --> 04:33.022
I hate you!

04:33.856 --> 04:36.401
Well, I hate you
times infinity, Lo'ak!

04:36.651 --> 04:37.652
Penis face!

04:37.819 --> 04:39.654
Hey! Hey! That's enough.

04:40.238 --> 04:41.823
Don't make me
come over there.

04:41.990 --> 04:42.991
He's gonna come out

04:43.074 --> 04:44.367
from behind those big rocks.

04:44.534 --> 04:45.785
There he is.

04:48.621 --> 04:49.789
There you go.
Go get it!

04:49.872 --> 04:50.873
Yeah!

04:51.499 --> 04:53.918
Hey, Neteyam,
the mighty fisherman.

04:54.419 --> 04:55.420
There you go. Good boy.

04:57.505 --> 04:58.506
Wow.

04:59.882 --> 05:01.009
Wow, that's a big one.

05:01.175 --> 05:02.593
By the rocks.

05:03.511 --> 05:04.512
Right where
you said.

05:05.346 --> 05:06.347
How tall is he?

05:06.514 --> 05:08.433
-- He's... that tall.
-- He's tall!

05:08.516 --> 05:09.726
Goes by
too fast.

05:10.393 --> 05:11.394
Like a dream.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.397
-- Kiri.
-- Bro, come on.

05:14.564 --> 05:15.565
Come on.

05:16.649 --> 05:17.650
Smile, skxawng.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.069
Happiness is simple.

05:23.531 --> 05:24.991
Like date night.

05:25.074 --> 05:26.367
Time away from the kids.

05:49.599 --> 05:51.309
Whoo!

05:58.149 --> 05:59.984
But the thing
about happiness...

06:02.403 --> 06:03.780
it can vanish
in a heartbeat.

06:10.495 --> 06:12.163
A new star in the night.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.375
It could only mean one thing.

06:22.799 --> 06:25.134
Ships. Decelerating.

06:34.143 --> 06:35.770
And Sky People returning.

08:54.951 --> 08:58.913
ONE YEAR LATER

09:05.962 --> 09:07.713
Pulse 168.
He's coming up...

09:07.880 --> 09:08.923
Yeah, here it comes.

09:09.090 --> 09:10.633
You're just fine.

09:10.716 --> 09:11.717
Just lie still.

09:12.218 --> 09:13.219
Stay calm.

09:15.221 --> 09:17.223
Yep. Pupillary reflex is good.

09:17.306 --> 09:18.307
Get that out
of his face.

09:18.391 --> 09:20.017
-Hey!
-Colonel,

09:20.518 --> 09:21.519
can you hear me?

09:21.602 --> 09:22.603
Colonel?

09:25.856 --> 09:27.191
You need
to lie back down, sir.

09:32.613 --> 09:33.698
Sedate him!
Sedate him!

09:33.781 --> 09:34.907
Get outta here!

09:34.991 --> 09:36.117
Go, go, go!

09:36.200 --> 09:37.201
Get security!

09:37.285 --> 09:38.286
-Grab him!
-Grab him!

09:38.369 --> 09:40.121
Hold him!

09:40.204 --> 09:41.330
Calm down!

09:41.414 --> 09:42.415
Colonel,
stand down!

09:42.748 --> 09:44.125
Colonel, it's me!

09:44.375 --> 09:45.376
Corporal Wainfleet!

09:49.463 --> 09:50.464
Lyle?

09:52.049 --> 09:53.050
That you?

09:53.551 --> 09:55.970
Yes, sir.
And Z Dog.

09:57.305 --> 09:58.306
And Fike.

10:01.767 --> 10:02.977
I'm all right.
Let me go.

10:03.769 --> 10:04.770
I'm all right.

10:26.167 --> 10:27.168
Well...

10:28.419 --> 10:30.296
ain't this a bitch.

10:39.639 --> 10:42.350
Stand by. Two
minutes to Pandora insertion.

10:42.433 --> 10:43.768
Secure for Delta V.

10:45.811 --> 10:47.188
All right.
Umbilical's clear.

10:48.272 --> 10:49.607
Pulse ox 89.

10:51.192 --> 10:52.985
In case you haven't
figured it out yet,

10:53.069 --> 10:54.820
you're Colonel Miles Quaritch.

10:54.987 --> 10:57.615
Only younger,
taller, bluer,

10:57.740 --> 10:59.325
and not nearly
as good-lookin'.

11:00.409 --> 11:02.078
In two hours,
I fly a mission

11:02.203 --> 11:03.954
against
the Na'vi's stronghold.

11:04.121 --> 11:05.831
The powers that be
thought it prudent

11:05.915 --> 11:08.876
that I do this backup
just in case.

11:09.043 --> 11:11.212
And if you are
watchin' it, well,

11:11.379 --> 11:13.464
it means that I did get
my ticket punched.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.676
Hey, Parker,

11:17.051 --> 11:18.844
just what the hell am I
supposed to say now?

11:19.345 --> 11:20.805
Just remind him
how this works.

11:20.888 --> 11:22.807
-Who?
-Here.

11:23.265 --> 11:24.892
So see this?
This is all your memories

11:24.975 --> 11:26.227
-and your personality.
-Right.

11:26.310 --> 11:27.311
We're gonna send this
back to Earth...

11:27.395 --> 11:28.396
All right, I got it.

11:28.479 --> 11:29.939
...where you're growing
in a lab as we speak.

11:30.022 --> 11:31.357
We're gonna imprint you
with it, and then...

11:31.440 --> 11:32.566
I got... Hey, hey, hey.

11:32.650 --> 11:34.110
Am I doin' this,
or are you doin' this?

11:34.193 --> 11:35.194
Hurry it up.
Hurry it up.

11:35.778 --> 11:37.196
Anyway,
the idea

11:37.321 --> 11:41.117
is to get the minds of the
saltiest on-world operators.

11:41.283 --> 11:43.911
Yeah, like Corporal Wainfleet
over there...

11:45.287 --> 11:46.330
...and your
humble narrator into...

11:46.414 --> 11:47.415
Oorah.

11:47.498 --> 11:49.041
...recombinant bodies.

11:49.792 --> 11:51.127
You're a recom now, Colonel,

11:51.210 --> 11:53.879
loaded with my memories
and my charm.

11:54.964 --> 11:56.674
What you won't remember
is my death

11:56.757 --> 11:58.300
because it hasn't
happened yet,

11:58.801 --> 12:00.010
and it ain't gonna.

12:00.177 --> 12:01.595
-- Damn right.
-- Hell yeah.

12:02.138 --> 12:03.305
Well, whatever happened,

12:04.724 --> 12:05.725
if you're any clone of mine,

12:05.808 --> 12:07.560
you'll be lookin'
for some payback.

12:07.727 --> 12:10.020
And Jake Sully would be
at the top of that list.

12:13.858 --> 12:14.859
Remember, kid,

12:15.609 --> 12:17.069
a Marine
can't be defeated.

12:17.862 --> 12:18.988
Oh, you can kill us,

12:19.822 --> 12:21.449
but we'll just
regroup in hell.

12:21.532 --> 12:22.908
Oorah.

12:22.992 --> 12:23.993
Semper fi.

12:52.688 --> 12:53.981
Ground team, go!

13:47.952 --> 13:49.203
Take this! Go!

13:54.041 --> 13:55.626
Let's go. Two minutes, people.
Let's go.

14:00.047 --> 14:01.882
Bro, we have got
to get down there.

14:02.424 --> 14:04.093
No way!
Dad will skin us!

14:04.260 --> 14:06.011
Come on.
Don't be a wuss.

14:06.554 --> 14:07.555
Lo'ak!

14:07.680 --> 14:09.306
Get back here, you...
Argh!

14:12.309 --> 14:13.310
Taking the whole case!

14:13.394 --> 14:15.312
We're taking mags,
the RPGs, the stingers.

14:19.441 --> 14:20.943
-Bro, let's go. Come on!
-Lo'ak!

14:21.026 --> 14:22.027
Okay, let's go!

14:22.319 --> 14:23.320
Lo'ak!

14:23.946 --> 14:24.947
Move! Take that!

14:25.865 --> 14:27.324
Take these weapons.
Here, boy. Go!

14:27.783 --> 14:29.451
Lo'ak!

14:29.785 --> 14:31.120
You don't even know
how to use it.

14:32.663 --> 14:33.914
Dad taught me.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.716
Gunship's inbound!
Fall back!

14:50.723 --> 14:51.724
Bro, come on!

15:01.942 --> 15:03.235
Lo'ak, where are you?

15:03.360 --> 15:04.403
Neteyam!

15:05.279 --> 15:06.739
Easy, easy, you okay?

15:06.906 --> 15:08.490
-Yeah.
-Where's your brother?

15:09.199 --> 15:10.326
-That way.
-Where is he? Where?

15:10.492 --> 15:11.994
Get outta here! Go on!

15:13.203 --> 15:14.204
Neteyam!

15:16.749 --> 15:17.750
Oh, no.

15:19.793 --> 15:21.462
Oh, no, no, no.

15:22.171 --> 15:23.213
Oh, God.

15:28.469 --> 15:29.470
Dad?

15:32.348 --> 15:33.390
What are you doin' here, boy?

15:33.474 --> 15:34.475
What the hell
were you thinkin'?

15:34.683 --> 15:36.560
I'm s... I'm sorry.

15:38.395 --> 15:39.438
I'm sorry, sir.

15:43.734 --> 15:45.861
We are not
in Kansas anymore.

15:46.987 --> 15:48.697
We are going to Pandora.

15:49.949 --> 15:50.991
Now,

15:51.575 --> 15:54.954
I know you're all askin'
yourselves the same question.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.083
Why so blue?

16:03.629 --> 16:04.922
For our sins in our past life,

16:05.005 --> 16:06.006
we have been
brought back

16:06.173 --> 16:08.467
in the form
of our enemy.

16:08.634 --> 16:12.554
That gives us their size,
their strength, their speed.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.974
And with our training,

16:15.391 --> 16:16.892
that's a pretty potent mix.

16:18.769 --> 16:19.979
Do we have a mission yet?

16:20.145 --> 16:21.355
Indeed we do.

16:22.314 --> 16:24.817
Our mission is to
hunt down and kill

16:24.984 --> 16:26.860
the leader of
the Na'vi insurgency.

16:27.778 --> 16:30.906
The one they call
Toruk Makto.

16:31.573 --> 16:32.825
Jake Sully.

16:32.992 --> 16:33.993
Yeah!

16:34.076 --> 16:35.077
That's what it is!

16:41.709 --> 16:43.210
Attack, attack!

16:44.128 --> 16:45.379
Got ya!

16:45.546 --> 16:47.006
-Tuk! Come on!
-Hyah!

16:47.548 --> 16:49.049
I'm definitely faster
when I'm blue.

16:49.216 --> 16:50.217
Skxawng.

16:50.384 --> 16:51.385
No, seriously.

16:51.468 --> 16:52.594
And the animals
respect me more.

16:52.761 --> 16:54.263
They don't think
of me as human.

16:54.430 --> 16:56.140
Wait.
You're human?

16:56.223 --> 16:57.307
Ha-ha.

17:02.980 --> 17:04.273
Whoosh!

17:06.275 --> 17:07.276
They're coming!

17:08.736 --> 17:11.280
HIGH CAMP, OMATIKAYA STRONGHOLD

17:12.614 --> 17:13.615
They're coming!

17:13.699 --> 17:14.700
Kiri, Spider!

17:14.992 --> 17:16.744
The war party's
coming back!

17:16.910 --> 17:18.162
Come on,
come on.

17:18.328 --> 17:19.705
Let's go,
come on.

17:34.344 --> 17:35.387
-Mom!
-Tuk...

17:35.554 --> 17:37.097
-Mom.
-Tuk, Tuk, Tuk, Tuk, Tuk.

17:39.433 --> 17:40.434
Fall in.

17:43.020 --> 17:44.480
You're supposed
to be spotters.

17:44.646 --> 17:46.315
You spot bogeys,
and you call 'em in.

17:46.440 --> 17:47.524
From a distance!

17:48.025 --> 17:49.777
Does any of this
sound familiar? Get here!

17:50.444 --> 17:52.362
Jesus. I let you two geniuses
fly a mission,

17:52.446 --> 17:54.198
and you disobey
direct orders.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.450
Kiri, can you go help
your grandmother

17:56.533 --> 17:57.534
with the wounded? Please?

17:57.701 --> 17:58.702
My brother
is wounded.

17:58.786 --> 17:59.953
-It's fine.
-Baby girl, please.

18:00.037 --> 18:01.705
-Tuk, go with her. Go.
-Dad.

18:01.872 --> 18:03.874
Sir. I take full responsibility.

18:03.957 --> 18:05.459
Yeah, you do.
That's right.

18:05.793 --> 18:06.794
'Cause you're
the older brother.

18:06.877 --> 18:08.337
You gotta act like it.

18:09.379 --> 18:10.547
MaJake.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.841
Your son is
actually bleeding.

18:13.008 --> 18:14.426
Mother, it's fine. I...

18:16.595 --> 18:18.514
Just go and get patched up.
Go on, dismissed.

18:24.228 --> 18:25.270
You do understand

18:25.354 --> 18:27.147
that you almost
got your brother killed.

18:27.731 --> 18:28.732
Yes, sir.

18:31.026 --> 18:32.611
You're grounded.
No flying for a month.

18:33.362 --> 18:35.114
Now, see to the ikran.
All of 'em.

18:35.197 --> 18:36.198
Yes, sir.

18:36.323 --> 18:37.908
And get that crap
off your face.

18:44.456 --> 18:46.041
Ow. Ow!

18:46.500 --> 18:48.836
Aw, want a kiss
on the boo-boo?

18:49.002 --> 18:50.087
-Give him this.
-Okay.

18:50.170 --> 18:51.421
I would use yalna bark.

18:51.505 --> 18:52.506
Here, drink.

18:52.589 --> 18:53.590
Oh, you would?

18:53.674 --> 18:55.134
And who is Tsahik?

18:55.634 --> 18:56.844
You are, Grand... Move!

18:57.302 --> 18:59.680
You are, Grandmother.
But yalna bark is better.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.807
Ow, ow! Ow.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.308
It stings less.

19:03.892 --> 19:05.227
Mighty Warrior.

19:13.068 --> 19:14.194
What?

19:16.655 --> 19:18.866
Neteyam and Lo'ak
try to live up to you.

19:20.659 --> 19:21.910
It is very hard on them.

19:23.620 --> 19:24.830
I know.

19:27.082 --> 19:29.168
You are very hard on them.

19:31.879 --> 19:33.755
I'm their father.
It's my job.

19:35.674 --> 19:37.384
This is not a squad.

19:37.551 --> 19:39.052
It is a family.

19:50.147 --> 19:51.815
I thought we'd lost them.

19:59.781 --> 20:00.824
We'll check
on this tomorrow.

20:00.908 --> 20:01.909
Hey, man.
How's it going?

20:01.992 --> 20:02.993
Hey, Spider.

20:03.327 --> 20:04.661
Your ass is mine.

20:04.745 --> 20:05.746
I'm right here.

20:05.829 --> 20:06.830
-- What's up, bro?
-- What up?

20:06.914 --> 20:08.415
Avatars only,
go around!

20:08.498 --> 20:10.083
Sorry.

20:10.500 --> 20:12.711
Yeah. Those blue stripes don't
make you any bigger, bro.

20:12.794 --> 20:13.795
Yeah, well,

20:13.879 --> 20:15.088
I can still kick your ass.

20:17.299 --> 20:19.635
Oof! Hell of a day.

20:19.801 --> 20:21.470
Long run.

20:21.553 --> 20:23.013
Like a little
annoying bug.

20:23.096 --> 20:25.349
Ha-ha. Real hysterical, guys.

20:25.515 --> 20:26.558
You know what
really sucks though?

20:26.642 --> 20:28.227
Is you can breathe
Earth air for hours,

20:28.393 --> 20:30.979
and I can only breathe your
air for, like, 10 seconds.

20:31.146 --> 20:33.523
Yeah, Monkey Boy,
that really sucks.

20:33.690 --> 20:35.150
For you.

20:38.153 --> 20:39.154
Oh!

20:41.657 --> 20:43.283
-Hi, Max.
-Hey, kids.

20:43.367 --> 20:44.701
-Hey. What's up, Max?
-What up?

20:44.785 --> 20:45.827
-What's up, Norm?
-Lo'ak.

20:51.500 --> 20:52.501
Hi, Ma.

21:03.136 --> 21:05.681
Maybe I'm just
losing it out here,

21:05.847 --> 21:07.599
but I'm seeing real evidence

21:07.724 --> 21:11.478
of a systemic response
on a global level.

21:12.229 --> 21:13.313
I can't...

21:14.606 --> 21:17.401
I won't use the term
"intelligence." It's, um...

21:18.610 --> 21:20.696
...maybe "awareness"
is a better word.

21:21.571 --> 21:25.534
It's like the entire
biosphere of Pandora

21:25.659 --> 21:27.035
is aware...

21:27.202 --> 21:30.289
and capable of
this cognitive response.

21:31.999 --> 21:33.375
Oh, crap,
I can't say that.

21:34.334 --> 21:35.377
They'll crucify me.

21:35.961 --> 21:37.796
I mean, I need
to say something that'll...

21:37.879 --> 21:39.881
So who do you think
knocked her up?

21:39.965 --> 21:41.883
Pretty sure it was Norm.

21:42.050 --> 21:43.051
Totally.

21:44.761 --> 21:46.471
You do not
deserve to live.

21:46.555 --> 21:48.015
No, no, no.
Think about it, right?

21:48.098 --> 21:49.474
I mean,
he's the teacher's pet.

21:49.641 --> 21:51.101
He's out at the lab
with her all the time.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.186
I would kill myself.

21:53.353 --> 21:54.688
I would drink acid.

21:54.855 --> 21:56.815
Bro, you're right.
He's, like, in every shot.

21:56.982 --> 21:59.234
Bro, look, look,
he's giving her looks.

21:59.401 --> 22:00.402
Hey.

22:01.069 --> 22:02.612
See, I'm thinkin'

22:02.779 --> 22:05.490
their two avatars were out
in the woods all alone...

22:05.907 --> 22:06.992
Gross!

22:07.075 --> 22:09.036
Guys. I mean,
sometimes it's not so great

22:09.119 --> 22:10.704
to know who your father was.

22:15.417 --> 22:16.418
Whatever.

22:17.085 --> 22:18.337
Don't even remember him.

22:18.754 --> 22:19.755
No, Spider.

22:19.838 --> 22:21.715
-Dude.
-Spider...

22:24.134 --> 22:25.552
You are not him.

22:34.644 --> 22:37.356
BRIDGEHEAD CITY

23:06.218 --> 23:08.762
Go, go, go!
Directly inside the terminal.

23:08.929 --> 23:09.971
Do not stop.

23:10.847 --> 23:11.848
Move!

23:13.809 --> 23:15.602
Masks off.

23:20.440 --> 23:21.441
Sir,

23:21.566 --> 23:22.943
this is the General.

23:32.702 --> 23:34.204
General Ardmore.

23:35.288 --> 23:36.581
-Good to meet you, Colonel.
-Hmm.

23:37.374 --> 23:38.583
I've heard good things,

23:39.376 --> 23:41.378
but a lot's changed
since your last tour here.

23:41.586 --> 23:42.587
Walk with me.

23:45.382 --> 23:47.592
The new
ops center is over here.

23:47.759 --> 23:48.927
That just came online.

23:49.719 --> 23:51.012
These Swarm Assemblers,

23:51.096 --> 23:52.722
they can put up a building
in six days.

23:53.849 --> 23:55.684
We have done
more here in a year

23:55.767 --> 23:57.519
than in the previous 30 years.

23:59.187 --> 24:01.106
We're not here to
run a mine, Colonel.

24:01.606 --> 24:02.691
As On-World Commander,

24:02.774 --> 24:04.693
I have been charged
with a greater mission.

24:10.198 --> 24:11.283
Earth is dying.

24:12.659 --> 24:15.787
Our task here
is to tame this frontier.

24:16.788 --> 24:18.415
Nothing less than
to make Pandora

24:18.498 --> 24:20.041
the new home
for humanity.

24:21.626 --> 24:23.670
But before
we can do that,

24:23.837 --> 24:26.089
we need to
pacify the hostiles.

24:28.884 --> 24:32.012
Sully's raids are becoming
bolder and more frequent.

24:32.929 --> 24:34.556
His strikes are well-planned.

24:34.723 --> 24:35.724
He's got tight coordination

24:35.807 --> 24:37.392
between his ground
and air assets.

24:38.393 --> 24:40.312
His forces are hitting
our outlying sites.

24:40.395 --> 24:42.272
The mines, pipelines,

24:42.439 --> 24:44.065
cutting off our supply chain.

24:44.691 --> 24:46.818
And they hit a maglev
two days ago.

24:51.781 --> 24:54.201
Any intel on Sully's
base of operations?

24:54.701 --> 24:56.036
Yeah.
Give me the mountains.

24:57.996 --> 24:58.997
It's a cave system

24:59.080 --> 25:00.957
in the Hallelujah Mountains
somewhere.

25:03.168 --> 25:05.128
But every time we send
our forces up there,

25:05.212 --> 25:06.213
we take losses.

25:07.589 --> 25:10.300
Our hardware really
stirs up the hornet's nest.

25:11.468 --> 25:13.345
We only get 10 minutes
in enemy airspace,

25:13.470 --> 25:14.888
they are all over us.

25:17.974 --> 25:19.059
Colonel,

25:19.142 --> 25:20.352
we believe your Blue Team

25:20.435 --> 25:22.103
will be perceived
as indigenous

25:22.270 --> 25:23.855
and will not trigger

25:23.939 --> 25:25.023
the immune response.

25:25.106 --> 25:27.859
And how might we test
that hypothesis, General?

25:28.902 --> 25:29.986
The hard way.

25:31.863 --> 25:32.989
Outstanding.

25:46.753 --> 25:48.380
We're entering
hostile airspace.

25:49.130 --> 25:50.173
Copy that.

25:57.222 --> 25:58.682
Go! Whoo!

25:59.182 --> 26:00.600
-- Whoo!
-- Whoa, bro!

26:00.684 --> 26:02.185
-- Uh-huh.
-- Go, Monkey Boy!

26:02.352 --> 26:04.521
Guys, wait up!

26:41.308 --> 26:42.892
Tuk!
Keep up!

26:43.560 --> 26:44.894
Okay, okay.

26:45.061 --> 26:46.396
Bro, why'd
you bring her anyway?

26:47.022 --> 26:48.106
She's such a cry baby.

26:48.648 --> 26:50.025
She's all, "I'm telling.

26:50.108 --> 26:51.818
"You're not supposed
to go to the battlefield.

26:51.901 --> 26:53.612
"I'll tell Mom
if you don't let me come."

26:53.778 --> 26:55.614
Don't pick on her.

26:56.990 --> 26:57.991
Come on.

26:59.492 --> 27:00.619
Oh, sick!

27:01.911 --> 27:03.288
Are there
any dead bodies up there?

27:03.913 --> 27:05.206
Bro, check it out.
Come on.

27:48.875 --> 27:50.627
No shit.

28:00.970 --> 28:02.514
Kiri.

28:02.931 --> 28:03.932
Kiri.

28:06.935 --> 28:07.936
Kiri...

28:08.436 --> 28:09.437
Kiri, hey.

28:09.604 --> 28:10.605
Hey.

28:10.772 --> 28:11.773
Kiri.

28:15.402 --> 28:16.653
Are you okay?

28:17.821 --> 28:20.031
I was doing that thing again,
wasn't I?

28:20.448 --> 28:22.242
Yeah, you were.

28:23.076 --> 28:24.869
-- Kiri!
-- Kiri!

28:24.953 --> 28:26.371
Kiri,
we have to get back.

28:26.454 --> 28:27.455
All right, come on.

28:32.752 --> 28:33.878
What is it?

28:34.754 --> 28:35.797
We're always
supposed to be home

28:35.880 --> 28:36.881
by eclipse.

28:39.634 --> 28:41.469
It's way too big
for a human.

28:41.636 --> 28:42.971
-Avatars?
-Maybe,

28:44.055 --> 28:45.932
but they're for sure
not ours.

28:47.684 --> 28:48.685
What are you doing?

28:48.852 --> 28:50.103
Shh, I'm tracking.

29:09.414 --> 29:10.415
Watch your six.

29:13.501 --> 29:14.502
Clear.

29:18.214 --> 29:19.215
Perimeter up.

29:32.979 --> 29:33.980
Damn.

29:56.503 --> 29:58.213
We are never
supposed to come here.

29:59.839 --> 30:01.132
Dad is going to ground you.

30:01.216 --> 30:02.425
Shh.
Can you stop?

30:02.509 --> 30:03.635
For life.

30:04.511 --> 30:05.845
Bro, we have got
to check this out.

30:06.179 --> 30:07.180
Let's go.

30:24.572 --> 30:25.573
Bro,

30:26.157 --> 30:27.617
that's where
your dad and my dad

30:28.493 --> 30:29.494
fought.

30:29.953 --> 30:31.704
That's your dad's actual suit.

30:32.247 --> 30:33.915
Holy shit.

30:35.166 --> 30:36.584
Lyle, see if you can

30:36.835 --> 30:38.628
pull some data
off that dash cam.

30:39.671 --> 30:41.631
That thing's
deader than shit, Colonel.

30:41.798 --> 30:43.299
-- So were we.
-- All right.

30:44.384 --> 30:45.385
I gotta call this in.

30:45.552 --> 30:46.970
No, bro, we're gonna
get in trouble.

30:47.136 --> 30:48.137
Let's go.

30:52.725 --> 30:54.018
Devil Dog, Devil Dog,

30:54.102 --> 30:55.270
this is Eagle Eye, over.

30:55.770 --> 30:57.522
Eagle Eye.
Send your traffic.

30:57.689 --> 30:58.982
I got eyes
on some guys.

31:00.149 --> 31:02.819
They look
like avatars,

31:03.027 --> 31:05.113
but they're in full camo
and carrying ARs.

31:05.864 --> 31:08.157
There's six of them.
Over.

31:08.324 --> 31:09.534
What's your pos?
Over.

31:10.910 --> 31:12.829
Oh... We're at the old shack.

31:16.291 --> 31:17.292
Who's "we"?

31:18.334 --> 31:20.295
Me, Spider, Kiri...

31:22.088 --> 31:23.089
and Tuk.

31:28.678 --> 31:30.513
Son, you listen to me
very carefully.

31:30.597 --> 31:31.598
You pull back
right now.

31:31.681 --> 31:32.682
Do not make a sound.

31:32.891 --> 31:34.142
You get the hell out of there.

31:34.225 --> 31:35.226
Move! You copy?

31:35.476 --> 31:36.477
Yes, sir,
moving out.

31:36.603 --> 31:37.896
-See, I told you!
-Go, go.

31:38.771 --> 31:39.772
Dad,

31:40.148 --> 31:41.316
I know
a quick way!

31:46.988 --> 31:48.573
You're going to be
in so much trouble.

31:48.698 --> 31:50.033
Shh! Kiri, stop.

31:50.199 --> 31:51.284
Guys, come on.

31:51.367 --> 31:52.535
It's almost eclipse,
come on.

31:52.911 --> 31:53.912
Tuk!

31:55.455 --> 31:56.456
Put it down!
Down!

31:57.290 --> 31:58.291
Put it down
or I'll shoot you!

31:58.499 --> 31:59.500
With me.

31:59.584 --> 32:00.877
Drop it! Right now!

32:02.128 --> 32:03.129
Do not move!
Put your hands up!

32:03.212 --> 32:04.631
Put it down. Put it down.

32:04.714 --> 32:06.090
-- Hands up!
-- Spider.

32:06.174 --> 32:07.759
-Down!
-Get 'em! Get 'em!

32:07.842 --> 32:09.510
-Kiri!
-Get over here! Come on!

32:09.594 --> 32:11.262
Get down!

32:11.346 --> 32:12.972
Stop fighting.

32:13.306 --> 32:14.724
Don't move!

32:14.849 --> 32:15.850
Check 'em
for weapons!

32:15.975 --> 32:17.477
-Kiri!
-Tuk.

32:17.685 --> 32:18.937
Be calm...

32:20.647 --> 32:21.981
Shut up. Don't move.

32:22.815 --> 32:24.067
What have we here?

32:25.985 --> 32:27.862
Stop.

32:33.660 --> 32:34.994
Hey, Colonel,

32:35.119 --> 32:36.120
check it out.

32:36.412 --> 32:37.455
Four fingers.

32:37.997 --> 32:39.082
We got a half-breed.

32:39.499 --> 32:40.500
Shit...

32:47.090 --> 32:48.341
Show me
your fingers.

32:53.846 --> 32:56.391
You're his,
aren't you?

32:58.559 --> 32:59.894
You're his,
all right.

33:01.646 --> 33:03.648
Lo'ak, don't.

33:04.315 --> 33:05.316
Don't!

33:06.693 --> 33:07.777
Where is he?

33:09.654 --> 33:11.614
Sorry, I don't speak your language...

33:12.198 --> 33:14.200
...to buttholes.

33:14.784 --> 33:16.452
Where is your father?

33:18.913 --> 33:19.914
No!

33:21.082 --> 33:22.709
Really?

33:22.834 --> 33:24.293
You wanna play it
this way?

33:26.212 --> 33:28.673
Shut up!

33:30.383 --> 33:31.384
Kiri!

33:31.467 --> 33:32.593
No!
Stop!

33:32.885 --> 33:35.138
Hey! Hey, don't touch her!

33:35.221 --> 33:36.222
Hey!

33:36.764 --> 33:37.807
Don't hurt her,
please.

33:40.059 --> 33:41.227
Don't move.

33:42.145 --> 33:43.271
What's your name, kid?

33:45.231 --> 33:46.399
Spider...

33:47.150 --> 33:48.151
Socorro.

33:57.201 --> 33:58.202
Miles?

34:01.914 --> 34:03.416
Nobody calls me that.

34:06.252 --> 34:07.670
Well,
I'll be damned...

34:09.213 --> 34:11.716
Well, I figured they sent you
back to Earth.

34:13.009 --> 34:15.053
They can't put babies
in cryo, dipshit.

34:22.477 --> 34:24.020
What are we doin', boss?

34:26.522 --> 34:28.274
Iron Sky, Blue One, Actual.

34:33.112 --> 34:34.489
Blue One, Iron Sky,
send your traffic.

34:35.364 --> 34:37.116
We are standing by
for extract, over.

34:37.950 --> 34:38.951
Take us in.

34:39.035 --> 34:40.036
Dragonfly
comin' left,

34:40.161 --> 34:41.579
we are go for extract.

34:42.038 --> 34:43.039
Be advised,

34:43.247 --> 34:44.624
we are bringin' in
high value prisoners.

34:44.791 --> 34:46.375
-Let us go!
-Shut up.

34:46.584 --> 34:47.668
Sit tight, Blue One,

34:47.835 --> 34:48.836
we're inbound
to your pos.

34:49.295 --> 34:50.630
That's bingo in ten.

34:50.797 --> 34:51.839
We're on the clock.

34:54.509 --> 34:55.718
-- Sit!
-- Come on, in the dirt!

34:55.802 --> 34:57.178
-Feet up!
-Get down on the ground!

34:57.345 --> 34:59.222
Lyle, get me
some audio on this.

35:00.431 --> 35:02.183
-- Shut your mouth.
-- Don't look up!

35:02.850 --> 35:04.060
That's Sully's woman.

35:05.770 --> 35:06.896
She's an animal.

35:08.064 --> 35:09.065
Give it up, Quaritch.

35:10.316 --> 35:11.317
Sully.

35:11.484 --> 35:12.902
-It's all over.
-Son of a bitch.

35:14.195 --> 35:15.905
Nothin's over
while I'm breathin'.

35:17.490 --> 35:18.825
I kinda hoped you'd say that.

35:33.965 --> 35:35.383
Down, down, down.

35:36.134 --> 35:37.343
No, no, you stay
with the ikran.

35:37.468 --> 35:38.469
But, Dad...

35:38.553 --> 35:40.054
I'm a warrior like you.
I'm supposed to fight.

35:40.138 --> 35:41.139
Neteyam.

35:41.222 --> 35:42.974
I'm not gonna
say it again.

35:44.016 --> 35:45.726
Yes, sir.

36:08.541 --> 36:09.959
Yeah, there's nothin'
after that.

36:24.265 --> 36:25.683
You want us to recover
these remains?

36:52.084 --> 36:53.878
Blue One, stand by ready.

36:54.003 --> 36:55.004
We are three
minutes out.

36:55.087 --> 36:56.881
Heads up, three minutes.

37:12.480 --> 37:13.481
Watch our six.

38:02.571 --> 38:03.572
Shut up!

38:18.379 --> 38:19.380
Shut up!

38:21.340 --> 38:22.466
Contact rear!

38:22.550 --> 38:23.676
-Contact rear!
-Kiri!

38:27.179 --> 38:28.180
Lo'ak!

38:28.973 --> 38:30.558
Shit.

38:32.977 --> 38:34.729
-You little shit.
-Lo'ak!

38:34.812 --> 38:36.230
-Tuk, come on. Go, go, go!
-Get back here!

38:36.397 --> 38:37.398
Run!

38:37.481 --> 38:38.482
Grab 'em!

38:45.781 --> 38:47.575
Come on!

38:47.825 --> 38:48.826
Cover! Go!

38:52.663 --> 38:53.664
Come on!

39:08.846 --> 39:10.431
That you,
Mrs. Sully?

39:11.098 --> 39:13.100
I recognize your calling card.

39:24.070 --> 39:25.738
Why don't you come on out,
Mrs. Sully?

39:27.448 --> 39:28.616
You and I,
we got some

39:29.158 --> 39:30.785
unfinished business.

39:31.369 --> 39:32.370
Spider, come!

39:35.331 --> 39:36.332
Demon!

39:36.832 --> 39:39.460
I will kill you as many times
as I have to!

39:40.628 --> 39:43.339
I guess you and
the Corporal have been pretty

39:43.547 --> 39:45.091
busy, haven't you?

39:45.257 --> 39:47.176
Dropped yourself
a whole litter of

39:47.968 --> 39:49.011
half-breeds.

39:57.978 --> 39:58.979
Na'vi!

40:01.607 --> 40:02.942
Move! Go, go, go!

40:05.319 --> 40:06.320
You okay?
You okay, boy?

40:06.404 --> 40:07.405
Yeah.

40:07.530 --> 40:09.115
Okay. With me.
Ready? Ready?

40:09.198 --> 40:10.199
Yes, sir!

40:12.201 --> 40:13.202
Move!

40:14.495 --> 40:15.496
Come on!

40:17.832 --> 40:18.833
Come on!

40:27.591 --> 40:28.592
Go, go, go!

40:29.427 --> 40:30.678
Flank out. Get after 'em!

40:36.976 --> 40:38.936
Spider?

40:42.314 --> 40:43.399
Spider!

40:43.566 --> 40:45.067
-Kiri!
-Spider.

40:45.609 --> 40:47.236
Come! Come on.

40:47.319 --> 40:49.530
Spider.
He's down there.

40:49.613 --> 40:51.073
No.

40:55.494 --> 40:56.704
Ma'am,
we're at bingo.

40:56.871 --> 40:58.330
Ten minutes in enemy airspace.

40:59.206 --> 41:00.958
Blue One. Get back
to the rally point now.

41:08.632 --> 41:10.009
Blue One, fall back.

41:10.342 --> 41:11.343
Fall back!

41:11.510 --> 41:12.720
Fall back, fall back!

41:13.012 --> 41:14.013
Move out! Move!

41:14.847 --> 41:15.848
Move, move, move!

41:16.390 --> 41:17.683
-Kiri!
-Spider!

41:17.766 --> 41:19.101
Come, come.

41:19.185 --> 41:20.394
-No.
-Come!

41:20.603 --> 41:21.687
Go, go, go.
Come on. Let's go.

41:24.482 --> 41:25.900
Hey. Hey, it's okay.
You hurt?

41:25.983 --> 41:26.984
-Are you hurt?
-No, I'm okay.

41:27.067 --> 41:28.068
-Tuk, you hurt?
-Daddy!

41:28.152 --> 41:29.153
Hey, hey, it's okay.

41:48.464 --> 41:49.465
Okay,
we're clear.

41:49.548 --> 41:50.549
We're clear.
Everyone okay?

41:50.633 --> 41:52.384
-Mom!
-Tuk.

41:53.594 --> 41:54.595
That's it.

41:55.471 --> 41:57.765
It's okay.
It's okay. We're okay.

41:58.098 --> 41:59.975
Oh, thank you, Great Mother.
Thank you.

42:00.893 --> 42:01.894
Thank you.

42:02.436 --> 42:03.437
Where's Spider?

42:04.813 --> 42:05.814
They took him.

42:06.899 --> 42:07.900
They took him.

42:08.442 --> 42:10.444
Okay. It's all right,
baby girl.

42:10.528 --> 42:11.612
All right?
He's a tough kid.

42:12.488 --> 42:13.531
All right. Shh.

42:15.533 --> 42:16.534
He's gonna be okay.

42:18.369 --> 42:19.662
We're all gonna be okay.

42:29.463 --> 42:30.464
Goddamn!

42:30.548 --> 42:31.549
Come on!

42:36.095 --> 42:37.471
Let me out
of here!

42:45.896 --> 42:47.022
He's completely feral.

42:47.940 --> 42:48.983
Thinks he's one of them.

42:53.320 --> 42:54.572
This thing.
This Quaritch.

42:54.738 --> 42:55.739
Whatever he is...

42:55.823 --> 42:56.824
What's going on?

42:56.907 --> 42:57.950
He can walk
right in here.

42:58.033 --> 42:59.034
He can walk right
under Eywa's nose.

42:59.118 --> 43:00.202
This is our family.
This is our home.

43:00.286 --> 43:01.287
This is
about our family.

43:01.370 --> 43:02.371
This is about
our little ones.

43:03.664 --> 43:05.749
I cannot.
You cannot ask this.

43:08.002 --> 43:09.670
I cannot leave
my People.

43:10.629 --> 43:11.630
I will not.

43:12.214 --> 43:13.299
He's hunting us.

43:15.175 --> 43:16.218
He's targeting
our family.

43:16.302 --> 43:17.720
You cannot ask this!

43:18.053 --> 43:19.054
The children.

43:19.138 --> 43:21.015
Everything they've ever known.
The forest.

43:21.473 --> 43:22.600
This is our home!

43:22.766 --> 43:23.934
He had our children.

43:24.101 --> 43:25.728
He had 'em
under his knife!

43:33.152 --> 43:34.737
My father gave me

43:34.862 --> 43:37.072
this bow
as he lay dying.

43:37.239 --> 43:39.325
And he said
protect the People.

43:40.618 --> 43:42.244
You're Toruk Makto!

43:43.454 --> 43:45.080
This will protect
the People!

43:45.539 --> 43:46.790
Quaritch has Spider.

43:46.915 --> 43:48.125
And that kid
knows everything.

43:48.292 --> 43:49.335
He knows
our whole operation,

43:49.418 --> 43:51.045
and he can lead them
right in here.

43:51.754 --> 43:54.256
If the People harbor us,
they will die.

43:55.841 --> 43:57.009
Do you understand?

44:01.680 --> 44:02.806
Look, I got nothing.

44:03.724 --> 44:04.892
I got no plan...

44:07.144 --> 44:08.854
But I can protect this family.

44:08.979 --> 44:10.689
That I can do.

44:24.036 --> 44:25.621
I know one thing.

44:28.624 --> 44:29.833
Wherever we go,

44:29.958 --> 44:31.752
this family is our fortress.

44:46.100 --> 44:47.184
Where is Jake Sully?

44:47.267 --> 44:49.269
I don't know!

44:50.229 --> 44:51.438
We know
that you know.

44:52.272 --> 44:53.607
I don't know!

44:53.774 --> 44:55.442
Just form a picture
in your mind.

44:55.818 --> 44:57.277
Is it one of
the floating mountains?

44:58.237 --> 44:59.405
Let me
out of here!

44:59.571 --> 45:01.031
He's fighting us.
Give us a minute.

45:01.198 --> 45:02.282
I don't know!

45:02.366 --> 45:04.535
Just form a thought,
and we will see it.

45:05.661 --> 45:06.995
I don't know!

45:07.496 --> 45:08.580
Look, I don't like this

45:08.664 --> 45:09.665
any more than you do.

45:10.833 --> 45:11.834
Which clans would be

45:11.917 --> 45:13.043
-harboring him?
-I don't know!

45:13.127 --> 45:14.461
You're gonna
have to kill me!

45:15.129 --> 45:17.047
Watch this.

45:17.131 --> 45:18.882
You're peaking
all over the prefrontal.

45:18.966 --> 45:20.050
It's not gonna stop

45:20.175 --> 45:21.218
until you give us something.

45:21.427 --> 45:23.262
Where is he?

45:23.345 --> 45:25.305
I don't know, you buttholes!
Okay?

45:25.389 --> 45:28.058
I don't know!

45:40.028 --> 45:42.489
General, let me try
the personal angle.

45:47.035 --> 45:48.328
He's not your son.

46:19.276 --> 46:22.070
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.
Easy, tiger. Easy.

46:30.954 --> 46:31.955
We good?

46:38.587 --> 46:39.713
Kid, you got heart.

46:40.798 --> 46:43.175
Those science pukes
leaned on you pretty hard.

46:44.384 --> 46:45.886
But you gave them nothin'.

46:48.055 --> 46:49.139
I respect that.

46:55.103 --> 46:56.688
I thought
you might want this.

47:05.113 --> 47:06.657
That's Colonel Miles Quaritch.

47:07.449 --> 47:08.450
Deceased.

47:09.117 --> 47:10.285
Killed in action.

47:15.999 --> 47:17.376
I'm not that man.

47:18.794 --> 47:22.506
But I do have
his memories...

47:25.634 --> 47:27.052
enough to know that, uh,

47:28.095 --> 47:29.847
well, he wasn't
always the best father.

47:31.807 --> 47:33.517
But that's not an apology.

47:34.768 --> 47:37.062
I'm not your father.
Technically,

47:37.229 --> 47:39.773
you and I,
we're nothin' to each other.

47:40.232 --> 47:41.233
But...

47:42.276 --> 47:43.527
I can help you.

47:44.528 --> 47:46.029
I can get you
outta here.

47:49.074 --> 47:52.286
Ah, I'm not gonna ask you
to betray Jake Sully.

47:52.411 --> 47:54.496
I know you'd never do that.
You're loyal,

47:56.081 --> 47:57.416
and I admire loyalty.

47:59.877 --> 48:01.211
Just ride along.

48:04.006 --> 48:06.717
Otherwise, I gotta give you
back to the lab coats.

48:15.934 --> 48:17.728
This is like stones
in my heart.

48:19.605 --> 48:22.274
Tarsem is wise
for his years.

48:22.441 --> 48:24.192
He will be
a strong Olo'eyktan.

48:26.236 --> 48:28.030
The leader must die.

48:32.326 --> 48:34.161
So the leader
can be born.

48:37.122 --> 48:39.374
Toruk Makto
will disappear.

48:41.668 --> 48:43.378
The People
will be safe.

49:10.072 --> 49:11.949
A father protects.

49:13.200 --> 49:14.910
It's what gives him meaning.

49:19.164 --> 49:20.666
One life ends.

49:21.792 --> 49:23.168
Another begins.

49:36.974 --> 49:38.266
Tuk.

49:41.895 --> 49:44.106
The sea clans are
a world unto themselves.

49:45.399 --> 49:46.942
Thousands of islands.

49:47.901 --> 49:49.403
An unknown territory

49:49.486 --> 49:51.697
into which we could
just vanish without a trace.

49:52.447 --> 49:54.157
Are we there yet?

50:19.433 --> 50:22.644
AWA'ATLU, A METKAYINA VILLAGE

50:59.973 --> 51:00.974
Hey,

51:01.058 --> 51:02.059
leave it.

51:03.560 --> 51:04.561
On me.

51:06.605 --> 51:07.606
Tuk.

51:09.191 --> 51:10.192
-- Be nice.
-- Who...

51:11.026 --> 51:12.194
-Who are they?
-Be nice.

51:13.779 --> 51:14.780
Hey.

51:24.039 --> 51:25.749
We don't know
why they are here.

51:32.047 --> 51:33.215
Where did
they come from?

51:33.381 --> 51:34.716
Easy.
Just be cool.

51:35.425 --> 51:36.551
Look.
What is that?

51:37.385 --> 51:38.595
Is that supposed
to be a tail?

51:56.238 --> 51:57.364
It's too small.

51:57.447 --> 51:58.490
How are they supposed
to swim?

51:58.615 --> 52:00.992
Do not.
Rotxo, Aonung.

52:03.703 --> 52:04.704
Hey.

52:29.604 --> 52:32.190
Tonowari was the chief
of the Metkayina,

52:32.399 --> 52:33.441
the Reef People.

52:34.651 --> 52:35.944
I See you,
Tonowari.

52:37.028 --> 52:38.196
Jakesully.

52:38.363 --> 52:39.698
I knew him
as a tough leader.

52:44.536 --> 52:46.371
But it wasn't Tonowari
I was worried about.

52:50.750 --> 52:52.335
I See you, Ronal.

52:52.502 --> 52:53.795
Tsahik of the Metkayina.

52:53.962 --> 52:55.130
I See you, Ronal.

52:57.382 --> 52:59.384
Why do you come to us,
Jakesully?

53:00.677 --> 53:01.761
We seek uturu.

53:02.304 --> 53:03.305
Uturu?

53:04.055 --> 53:05.557
Yes, sanctuary
for my family.

53:08.685 --> 53:10.395
We are Reef People.

53:10.562 --> 53:11.730
You are Forest People.

53:11.813 --> 53:13.273
Your skills
will mean nothing here.

53:14.065 --> 53:16.318
Well, we will learn your ways.
Am I right?

53:16.401 --> 53:17.402
Yes.

53:20.864 --> 53:22.199
Their arms are thin.

53:23.200 --> 53:24.618
-Mom.
-Their tails...

53:24.701 --> 53:26.620
-Ow.
-...are weak.

53:26.786 --> 53:28.371
You will be slow
in the water.

53:31.625 --> 53:32.918
These children

53:33.084 --> 53:34.878
-are not even true Na'vi.
-Dad.

53:36.880 --> 53:38.089
Yes, we are!

53:41.635 --> 53:43.053
They have demon blood!

53:48.058 --> 53:49.351
Look. Look.

53:51.353 --> 53:52.562
Look, I was born
of the Sky People,

53:52.646 --> 53:54.856
and now I am Na'vi.
All right? You can adapt.

53:55.482 --> 53:56.691
We will adapt.

53:56.942 --> 53:57.943
Okay?

53:58.944 --> 54:01.029
My husband
was Toruk Makto.

54:02.906 --> 54:06.993
He led the clans to victory
against the Sky People.

54:10.747 --> 54:11.957
This you call victory?

54:13.124 --> 54:14.793
Hiding among strangers?

54:19.089 --> 54:21.633
It seems Eywa has turned
her back on you,

54:21.716 --> 54:22.801
Chosen One.

54:28.932 --> 54:30.684
I apologize for my mate.
She's...

54:30.767 --> 54:31.851
Do not apologize for me.

54:31.935 --> 54:33.520
...flown a long way,
and she's exhausted.

54:33.603 --> 54:34.604
Jake.

54:39.776 --> 54:42.362
Toruk Makto
is a great war leader.

54:43.196 --> 54:45.907
All Na'vi people
know his story.

54:46.032 --> 54:47.409
But we Metkayina...

54:47.575 --> 54:48.994
-Dad.
-...are not at war.

54:51.871 --> 54:54.624
We cannot let you
bring your war here.

54:54.791 --> 54:56.668
I'm done with war.

54:56.835 --> 54:57.836
Okay?

54:58.420 --> 55:00.338
I just want to keep
my family safe.

55:04.843 --> 55:06.845
Uturu has been asked.

55:11.766 --> 55:12.892
Do we have to go?

55:13.226 --> 55:14.686
Shh, we'll be okay.

55:27.407 --> 55:29.909
Toruk Makto and his family
will stay with us.

55:31.119 --> 55:33.455
Treat them
as our brothers and sisters.

55:34.914 --> 55:36.750
Now, they do not know the sea.

55:37.625 --> 55:39.377
So they will be
like babies

55:40.337 --> 55:41.838
taking their first breath.

55:42.839 --> 55:43.840
Teach them our ways,

55:43.923 --> 55:47.010
so they do not suffer
the shame of being

55:47.177 --> 55:48.511
useless.

55:50.263 --> 55:51.431
Okay, what do we say?

55:51.556 --> 55:52.557
Thank you.

55:52.682 --> 55:53.683
-- Thank you.
-- Thank you.

55:54.017 --> 55:55.018
Thank you.

55:55.560 --> 55:57.228
My son, Aonung,
our daughter, Tsireya,

55:57.312 --> 55:59.230
will show your children
what to do.

55:59.606 --> 56:01.232
-Father, why do...
-It is decided.

56:02.108 --> 56:04.736
Come. I will show you
our village.

56:15.288 --> 56:16.289
This way.

56:19.167 --> 56:21.211
Tuk, let's go.

56:21.711 --> 56:22.754
Just up here.

56:23.505 --> 56:24.589
No, no.

56:31.388 --> 56:32.639
This is for you.

56:33.390 --> 56:34.974
Your new home.

56:35.767 --> 56:36.768
Yeah, this will work.

56:37.769 --> 56:38.853
This is great.

56:39.020 --> 56:40.021
It's nice, right?

56:53.576 --> 56:54.702
Okay, Sullys, fall in.

56:54.869 --> 56:56.621
Remember? Family meeting.

56:56.704 --> 56:57.747
Come on.
Take a knee. Let's go.

56:57.831 --> 56:58.832
Kiri.

56:59.249 --> 57:00.250
What?

57:00.333 --> 57:01.918
Okay.

57:02.168 --> 57:03.711
I need you kids

57:03.795 --> 57:05.630
on your best behavior.

57:05.797 --> 57:07.298
I mean it.

57:07.465 --> 57:08.925
Learn fast.
Pull your weight.

57:09.968 --> 57:12.262
Don't cause trouble.
You got it?

57:12.429 --> 57:14.097
Yes, sir.

57:16.141 --> 57:17.892
I want to go home.

57:19.853 --> 57:21.479
Oh, Tuk.

57:22.105 --> 57:25.483
Tuk, this is
our home now.

57:26.860 --> 57:30.280
Now we're gonna
get through this.

57:30.363 --> 57:31.406
We're gonna
get through this

57:31.531 --> 57:33.366
if we have each other's backs.
All right?

57:33.533 --> 57:35.535
What does your father
always say?

57:36.161 --> 57:38.580
Sullys stick together.

57:38.746 --> 57:40.957
That's right.
Sullys stick together.

57:41.124 --> 57:42.750
Now this time
with some feeling.

57:42.917 --> 57:44.085
Yeah.

57:44.169 --> 57:45.170
Sullys stick together.

57:45.378 --> 57:46.546
Sullys stick together.

57:46.629 --> 57:48.590
Sullys stick together.

57:59.184 --> 58:00.185
Come on.

58:00.518 --> 58:01.644
Whoo-hoo!

58:07.442 --> 58:08.526
Whoo!

59:37.740 --> 59:39.534
Swim together with us.

01:00:13.985 --> 01:00:15.570
What's wrong with them?

01:00:16.654 --> 01:00:18.364
Those guys are bad divers.

01:00:18.489 --> 01:00:19.574
Stop.

01:00:20.158 --> 01:00:21.576
They're learning.

01:00:32.295 --> 01:00:33.421
Are you all right?

01:00:33.504 --> 01:00:35.006
You're too fast!

01:00:35.089 --> 01:00:36.174
Wait for us.

01:00:37.091 --> 01:00:38.176
Just breathe.

01:00:38.301 --> 01:00:39.302
Breathe.

01:00:39.427 --> 01:00:40.553
You are not good divers.

01:00:41.262 --> 01:00:42.930
Maybe good at swinging
through trees, but...

01:00:44.098 --> 01:00:45.099
Come on, bro.

01:00:45.224 --> 01:00:47.268
We don't speak
this finger talk, guys.

01:00:47.352 --> 01:00:48.353
We don't know
what you're saying.

01:00:48.853 --> 01:00:49.854
I will teach you.

01:00:49.937 --> 01:00:51.356
-- Where is Kiri?
-- Kiri?

01:00:51.522 --> 01:00:52.523
-- Who?
-- Kiri.

01:00:52.607 --> 01:00:53.608
Where is Kiri?

01:00:53.691 --> 01:00:55.109
Did you see her?

01:01:05.703 --> 01:01:07.205
Get on the ship,

01:01:07.372 --> 01:01:08.873
find a seat,
and keep out of the way.

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:10.249
Ready for transport!

01:01:10.416 --> 01:01:11.417
Let's go!

01:01:12.168 --> 01:01:13.169
Chop-chop.

01:01:13.252 --> 01:01:14.253
Sweet.

01:01:14.671 --> 01:01:16.798
Whoa,
hold on there, hotshot!

01:01:18.007 --> 01:01:19.008
You listen up.

01:01:20.259 --> 01:01:22.470
There's a tracker
built in that mask.

01:01:22.637 --> 01:01:24.639
We hit the ground,
and you take off,

01:01:24.806 --> 01:01:26.974
I'll have you back
in two minutes,

01:01:27.141 --> 01:01:29.727
and I will give you
a old-school ass-whippin'.

01:01:29.894 --> 01:01:30.895
Understood?

01:01:32.021 --> 01:01:33.147
Understood?

01:01:33.648 --> 01:01:34.816
Yes, sir.

01:01:35.191 --> 01:01:36.192
We up?

01:01:36.359 --> 01:01:37.360
Team's up.

01:01:51.916 --> 01:01:53.042
All right, listen up.

01:01:54.419 --> 01:01:56.629
Jake Sully's
gone to ground.

01:01:57.130 --> 01:01:58.131
Don't matter.

01:01:58.297 --> 01:01:59.674
Wherever he is,
we'll find him,

01:01:59.841 --> 01:02:02.552
and his batshit
crazy wife, too.

01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:05.430
To do so,

01:02:05.596 --> 01:02:07.849
we go Na'vi.

01:02:08.015 --> 01:02:09.267
Full tilt,
all the way.

01:02:09.350 --> 01:02:11.602
That means we eat Na'vi.

01:02:11.686 --> 01:02:13.771
We ride Na'vi.

01:02:13.938 --> 01:02:15.773
Think Na'vi.

01:02:15.940 --> 01:02:20.611
And that starts with
speaking the language.

01:02:23.906 --> 01:02:25.950
You call that speaking the language?

01:02:26.325 --> 01:02:28.911
You sound like a three year old!

01:02:31.414 --> 01:02:32.623
All right, smart guy.

01:02:33.541 --> 01:02:35.877
You just went from
bein' our monkey mascot

01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:38.045
to official interpreter.

01:02:44.969 --> 01:02:46.763
These are ilu.

01:02:46.846 --> 01:02:48.514
If you want
to live here,

01:02:48.681 --> 01:02:49.932
you have to ride.

01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:52.226
Make the bond gently.

01:02:57.774 --> 01:02:59.484
Feel his breath.

01:02:59.650 --> 01:03:01.110
Feel his strength.

01:03:03.321 --> 01:03:04.322
Hold here.

01:03:05.448 --> 01:03:06.616
Look at his legs.

01:03:06.908 --> 01:03:08.701
Hold on.

01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:28.221
You all right,

01:03:28.304 --> 01:03:29.555
Forest Boy?

01:03:39.607 --> 01:03:41.150
This is a warrior's mount.

01:03:41.317 --> 01:03:42.652
Not easy to master.

01:03:42.819 --> 01:03:45.321
Perhaps you should

01:03:45.488 --> 01:03:46.531
start with an ilu.

01:03:47.073 --> 01:03:48.157
Nah.
This one.

01:03:51.452 --> 01:03:52.745
Now remember,

01:03:53.246 --> 01:03:55.540
when you dive back in,
good position.

01:03:55.706 --> 01:03:56.707
Very important.

01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:59.877
Uh-huh.

01:04:00.336 --> 01:04:01.337
I got this.

01:04:04.757 --> 01:04:06.384
Whew!

01:04:06.467 --> 01:04:07.593
Hyah!

01:04:10.137 --> 01:04:11.222
Come on.

01:04:28.072 --> 01:04:29.240
That's it, okay.

01:04:30.491 --> 01:04:31.492
Steady.

01:04:45.965 --> 01:04:48.134
Ah, shit.

01:05:17.997 --> 01:05:19.749
I love her already.

01:05:59.914 --> 01:06:01.916
Breathe in.

01:06:04.210 --> 01:06:06.837
And breathe out.

01:06:06.921 --> 01:06:09.048
Imagine flickering a flame.

01:06:11.133 --> 01:06:14.136
You must slow down
your heartbeat.

01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:17.890
Breathe in.

01:06:17.974 --> 01:06:20.142
Breathe from down here.

01:06:21.644 --> 01:06:23.604
Breathe out slowly.

01:06:25.773 --> 01:06:28.317
Lo'ak, your heartbeat is fast.

01:06:28.484 --> 01:06:30.111
-Sorry.
-Try to focus.

01:06:30.277 --> 01:06:31.737
-Okay.
-Breathe in.

01:06:33.739 --> 01:06:35.491
And breathe out.

01:06:35.658 --> 01:06:37.201
Let your mind go clear.

01:06:54.343 --> 01:06:55.511
Whoo!

01:06:55.594 --> 01:06:58.139
You are learning to breathe.

01:07:03.728 --> 01:07:05.604
Come on!
Keep up, losers!

01:07:20.161 --> 01:07:21.162
I got this.

01:07:28.044 --> 01:07:29.086
What?

01:07:29.253 --> 01:07:32.048
Na'vi kids younger than me
do this with their bare hands.

01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:36.302
Jake Sully did it
the hard way?

01:07:37.011 --> 01:07:38.220
What do you think?

01:07:41.766 --> 01:07:42.850
What are we doin', Colonel?

01:07:47.938 --> 01:07:48.939
This is gonna be good.

01:07:52.318 --> 01:07:53.527
All right, move up.

01:08:00.993 --> 01:08:02.495
It's you and me, cupcake.

01:08:12.505 --> 01:08:14.173
Ooh.

01:08:16.050 --> 01:08:18.219
Did I mention you're supposed
to tie the mouth shut first?

01:08:19.345 --> 01:08:20.596
Thanks a lot, kid!

01:08:22.389 --> 01:08:24.308
Whoa... Whoa!

01:08:25.726 --> 01:08:26.727
Move up, move up!

01:08:34.693 --> 01:08:35.694
You see 'em?

01:08:49.208 --> 01:08:51.085
Whew!

01:08:58.008 --> 01:08:59.718
All right,
let's go. We're Oscar Mike.

01:08:59.844 --> 01:09:00.845
Come on.

01:09:03.639 --> 01:09:05.015
Let's go.
We're outta here.

01:09:10.146 --> 01:09:12.148
Yeah!

01:09:12.606 --> 01:09:13.732
That's right!

01:09:16.318 --> 01:09:17.903
Yeah, Colonel!
Get some!

01:09:18.070 --> 01:09:19.113
Yeah, Colonel!

01:09:19.196 --> 01:09:20.447
Who's up next?

01:09:29.165 --> 01:09:32.751
The way of water has
no beginning and no end.

01:09:37.423 --> 01:09:39.466
The sea is around you

01:09:40.050 --> 01:09:41.051
and in you.

01:09:47.349 --> 01:09:49.852
The sea is your home

01:09:50.477 --> 01:09:52.271
before your birth

01:09:53.230 --> 01:09:55.065
and after your death.

01:10:00.779 --> 01:10:04.366
Our hearts beat
in the womb of the world.

01:10:06.827 --> 01:10:11.165
Our breath burns
in the shadows of the deep.

01:10:12.499 --> 01:10:14.335
The sea gives

01:10:15.711 --> 01:10:17.504
and the sea takes.

01:10:20.507 --> 01:10:23.427
Water connects all things.

01:10:25.596 --> 01:10:27.431
Life to death.

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:30.601
Darkness

01:10:32.269 --> 01:10:33.270
to light.

01:10:35.231 --> 01:10:36.440
I got it!

01:10:36.523 --> 01:10:38.609
-Tsireya!
-You did it!

01:10:54.917 --> 01:10:58.128
It gives breath under water.

01:11:41.213 --> 01:11:42.881
What is she doing?

01:11:42.965 --> 01:11:43.966
I don't know.

01:11:44.133 --> 01:11:45.718
She's just
looking at the sand.

01:11:46.927 --> 01:11:47.928
Huh?

01:11:48.429 --> 01:11:49.596
What'd you say?

01:11:49.972 --> 01:11:52.599
Are you some kind of...
freak?

01:11:53.434 --> 01:11:54.893
He asked
if you are a freak.

01:11:57.896 --> 01:11:58.897
No.

01:11:59.273 --> 01:12:00.816
Are you sure?

01:12:00.983 --> 01:12:02.526
I mean, you're
not even real Na'vi.

01:12:03.235 --> 01:12:04.570
Look at these hands.

01:12:04.862 --> 01:12:05.946
I mean,
look at them...

01:12:06.030 --> 01:12:07.823
Hey!

01:12:08.324 --> 01:12:09.700
Back off,
fishlips!

01:12:09.867 --> 01:12:12.119
Oh, another
four-fingered freak.

01:12:12.286 --> 01:12:13.579
Look at his little baby tail!

01:12:13.662 --> 01:12:15.372
-Don't touch me!
-Aw, baby tail!

01:12:15.497 --> 01:12:16.707
Leave us alone!

01:12:17.124 --> 01:12:18.167
He's not normal.

01:12:18.334 --> 01:12:20.044
-- Look at his tail.
-- Aw, baby tail!

01:12:20.294 --> 01:12:21.462
It is so cute!

01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:24.006
You heard
what she said.

01:12:24.965 --> 01:12:26.175
Leave them alone.

01:12:26.675 --> 01:12:27.801
Ah, big brother come...

01:12:29.053 --> 01:12:30.387
Back off.

01:12:31.513 --> 01:12:32.681
Now.

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:39.897
Smart choice.

01:12:40.314 --> 01:12:41.732
And from now on,

01:12:41.899 --> 01:12:43.901
I need you to respect
my sister.

01:12:47.863 --> 01:12:48.864
Let's go.

01:12:52.159 --> 01:12:53.577
Buh-bye!

01:12:53.911 --> 01:12:54.995
Look at them.

01:12:55.079 --> 01:12:56.080
They're all freaks.

01:12:56.246 --> 01:12:58.123
The whole family.

01:12:59.541 --> 01:13:00.542
Lo'ak.

01:13:00.709 --> 01:13:01.710
I got this, bro.

01:13:05.381 --> 01:13:06.799
I know this hand is funny.

01:13:06.965 --> 01:13:09.510
Look, I'm a freak.
An alien.

01:13:10.928 --> 01:13:12.721
But it can do
something really cool.

01:13:12.888 --> 01:13:13.889
Watch.

01:13:14.056 --> 01:13:16.392
First, I ball it up
real tight like this.

01:13:16.475 --> 01:13:17.684
Okay? Then...

01:13:21.897 --> 01:13:22.940
It's called a punch, bitch!

01:13:23.107 --> 01:13:24.441
Don't ever touch
my sister again.

01:13:26.026 --> 01:13:27.653
Yeah! Aonung!
Show him!

01:13:29.655 --> 01:13:31.782
Come here!

01:13:31.865 --> 01:13:32.866
Hey! Hey!

01:13:37.329 --> 01:13:39.039
Stop this!

01:13:39.581 --> 01:13:40.582
Stop it!

01:13:42.835 --> 01:13:43.961
So stupid!

01:13:47.339 --> 01:13:48.340
Ow, my tail!

01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:52.386
My ear!
Let go!

01:13:52.719 --> 01:13:54.888
He's got my ear!

01:13:59.768 --> 01:14:01.603
What was the one thing
I asked? The one thing!

01:14:02.229 --> 01:14:03.522
-Stay out of trouble.
-Stay out of trouble.

01:14:03.605 --> 01:14:04.606
-Right.
-It was my fault.

01:14:04.690 --> 01:14:05.691
I don't think so.

01:14:05.816 --> 01:14:07.401
You gotta stop takin' the heat
for this knucklehead.

01:14:07.568 --> 01:14:09.319
Look, Dad.
Aonung was picking on Kiri.

01:14:10.028 --> 01:14:11.029
He called her a freak.

01:14:15.075 --> 01:14:16.285
Go apologize
to Aonung.

01:14:16.785 --> 01:14:17.786
What?

01:14:17.953 --> 01:14:19.872
He is the chief's son.
Do you understand?

01:14:20.831 --> 01:14:22.541
I don't care how you do it.
Just go make peace.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.001
Just go.

01:14:29.173 --> 01:14:30.174
Hey.

01:14:32.134 --> 01:14:33.469
So what'd
the other guys look like?

01:14:34.303 --> 01:14:35.345
Worse.

01:14:36.013 --> 01:14:37.014
That's good.

01:14:37.598 --> 01:14:38.599
A lot worse.

01:14:38.891 --> 01:14:40.100
Get outta here.

01:14:51.695 --> 01:14:52.779
What is wrong?

01:14:54.781 --> 01:14:56.575
Nothing. I'm fine.

01:14:57.743 --> 01:14:59.578
Why should I not be fine?

01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:09.254
Why can't I just be
like everyone else?

01:15:11.298 --> 01:15:12.633
Oh, Kiri.

01:15:16.261 --> 01:15:18.555
Ah, what's tree boy
doing here?

01:15:21.850 --> 01:15:22.935
I'm sorry I hit you.

01:15:23.810 --> 01:15:24.978
So many times.

01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:31.401
Ah.

01:15:31.485 --> 01:15:32.986
We should be friends.

01:15:35.614 --> 01:15:36.615
Come hunting with us.

01:15:37.324 --> 01:15:38.450
Outside the reef.

01:15:39.284 --> 01:15:40.786
It's where
the men hunt.

01:15:41.870 --> 01:15:43.330
No way. I'm not allowed.

01:15:44.122 --> 01:15:45.958
I must be asking
the wrong brother.

01:15:46.833 --> 01:15:47.834
Let's do it.

01:15:48.126 --> 01:15:49.127
Ah!

01:16:02.891 --> 01:16:04.476
Come on! Come on!

01:16:05.602 --> 01:16:06.603
Yeah!

01:16:08.897 --> 01:16:11.191
Whoo!

01:16:14.528 --> 01:16:15.988
Keep up, Forest Boy!

01:16:17.030 --> 01:16:18.365
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

01:16:19.825 --> 01:16:24.079
THREE BROTHERS ROCKS

01:16:31.295 --> 01:16:32.796
-Hey, you lived!
-Whoo!

01:16:33.380 --> 01:16:34.840
That was insane, cuz!

01:16:36.049 --> 01:16:37.050
This way.

01:16:37.175 --> 01:16:38.176
I know a good spot.

01:16:51.064 --> 01:16:52.691
Call the fish.

01:17:08.707 --> 01:17:10.125
What a moron!

01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:31.521
Hey, guys!

01:17:32.272 --> 01:17:33.273
Hey!

01:17:35.859 --> 01:17:36.860
Aonung!

01:17:38.403 --> 01:17:39.780
Come on, this isn't funny!

01:17:51.958 --> 01:17:52.959
Hey, Aonung!

01:21:27.883 --> 01:21:29.050
Holy shit.

01:21:58.204 --> 01:21:59.205
You're a tulkun.

01:22:02.959 --> 01:22:04.002
You saved my life.

01:22:04.669 --> 01:22:05.670
Thank you.

01:22:07.088 --> 01:22:08.089
Thank you.

01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:16.932
Buddy, I have no idea
what you just said.

01:22:23.939 --> 01:22:25.482
They hurt you, didn't they?

01:22:27.901 --> 01:22:29.152
I'll try to pull it out.

01:22:30.695 --> 01:22:31.821
Just trust me, okay?

01:23:06.898 --> 01:23:07.899
Friends?

01:23:11.528 --> 01:23:12.946
That's right,
we're friends.

01:23:13.029 --> 01:23:14.531
Friends.

01:23:14.614 --> 01:23:16.449
Oh!

01:23:18.243 --> 01:23:19.494
Whoa, whoa! Bro!

01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:32.567
I'm sorry.

01:25:11.397 --> 01:25:13.024
So, what is it,
baby girl?

01:25:14.359 --> 01:25:15.985
You missin' Spider?

01:25:18.905 --> 01:25:19.906
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

01:25:21.032 --> 01:25:22.283
But that's not it.

01:25:24.828 --> 01:25:25.829
Okay...

01:25:27.664 --> 01:25:29.791
So what is it?

01:25:29.874 --> 01:25:31.209
I feel her, Dad.

01:25:33.878 --> 01:25:34.879
You feel who?

01:25:35.630 --> 01:25:36.631
Eywa.

01:25:41.344 --> 01:25:42.846
I hear her breathing.

01:25:44.222 --> 01:25:45.723
I hear her heartbeat.

01:25:47.183 --> 01:25:48.560
She's so close.

01:25:49.811 --> 01:25:52.021
She's just there...

01:25:53.982 --> 01:25:55.775
like a word
about to be spoken.

01:26:01.739 --> 01:26:03.575
I know you think I'm crazy.

01:26:06.369 --> 01:26:08.329
You're not crazy,
baby girl.

01:26:12.750 --> 01:26:15.086
So what does Eywa's
heartbeat sound like?

01:26:20.175 --> 01:26:21.467
Mighty.

01:26:29.184 --> 01:26:30.643
Tell him
what you told me!

01:26:36.441 --> 01:26:38.026
You like
lookin' at the stars?

01:26:41.362 --> 01:26:43.114
You know, my dad
came from a star.

01:26:44.657 --> 01:26:45.658
That one.

01:26:45.742 --> 01:26:46.743
Right there.

01:26:49.245 --> 01:26:50.914
Lo'ak!

01:26:51.289 --> 01:26:52.665
Oh, man.
I'm in trouble.

01:26:55.668 --> 01:26:57.420
Go. I will see you again.

01:27:16.105 --> 01:27:18.191
-- The boy has returned!
-- It is the Sully boy.

01:27:18.274 --> 01:27:19.400
-- They found the boy.
-- They found him.

01:27:19.484 --> 01:27:20.485
They found the boy.

01:27:25.490 --> 01:27:26.491
Hey, hey.

01:27:29.202 --> 01:27:30.203
Let's have a look
at you. Okay.

01:27:31.537 --> 01:27:32.830
He's fine.
He's fine,

01:27:32.914 --> 01:27:34.916
-yeah. Just a few scratches.
-Lo'ak!

01:27:37.961 --> 01:27:39.462
I pray for the strength
that I will not

01:27:39.587 --> 01:27:42.340
pluck the eyeballs out of
my youngest son!

01:27:43.174 --> 01:27:44.175
No.

01:27:44.634 --> 01:27:47.220
My son knows better than
to take him outside the reef.

01:27:49.681 --> 01:27:51.391
The blame is his.

01:27:52.684 --> 01:27:54.102
Okay, let's go.

01:27:54.602 --> 01:27:55.603
No.

01:27:56.062 --> 01:27:57.272
This is not Aonung's fault.

01:27:58.022 --> 01:27:59.274
This was my idea.

01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:00.942
Aonung tried
to talk me out of it.

01:28:01.901 --> 01:28:02.902
Really.

01:28:03.569 --> 01:28:04.570
Come on.

01:28:04.654 --> 01:28:05.738
Lo'ak.

01:28:05.822 --> 01:28:06.864
I'm sorry.

01:28:07.615 --> 01:28:08.616
Come on.

01:28:11.577 --> 01:28:12.578
I got this.

01:28:15.832 --> 01:28:17.375
Is this true?

01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:19.544
Aonung.
What were you thinking?

01:28:22.797 --> 01:28:24.757
Dad, you told me to make
friends with these kids.

01:28:24.924 --> 01:28:26.759
-That's all I was trying to...
-I don't want to hear it.

01:28:26.926 --> 01:28:27.927
Dad...

01:28:28.094 --> 01:28:29.595
You brought shame
to this family.

01:28:32.890 --> 01:28:34.017
Can I go now?

01:28:34.559 --> 01:28:36.227
Any more trouble,
I jerk a knot in your tail.

01:28:36.311 --> 01:28:37.437
You read me?

01:28:37.979 --> 01:28:39.897
Yes, sir.
Lima Charlie.

01:28:43.484 --> 01:28:44.694
Go on.

01:28:50.616 --> 01:28:51.826
Where were you?

01:28:51.993 --> 01:28:52.994
Yeah.

01:28:53.077 --> 01:28:54.954
What happened to
"keep an eye on your brother"?

01:28:55.621 --> 01:28:56.664
Sorry, sir.

01:29:01.252 --> 01:29:02.837
Why did you speak for me?

01:29:03.296 --> 01:29:04.714
Because I know
what it's like

01:29:04.797 --> 01:29:06.299
to be one big disappointment.

01:29:09.927 --> 01:29:11.804
I wish I'd been there.

01:29:11.929 --> 01:29:13.848
The ocean blessed you
with a gift, brother.

01:29:14.557 --> 01:29:16.893
The tulkun
have not returned yet.

01:29:17.060 --> 01:29:19.020
And anyway,
no tulkun is ever alone.

01:29:19.812 --> 01:29:20.897
Well, this one was.

01:29:21.814 --> 01:29:23.649
He had a missing fin.

01:29:23.775 --> 01:29:24.776
Like a stump.

01:29:24.859 --> 01:29:26.694
-On the left side.
-Poor tulkun.

01:29:27.403 --> 01:29:28.404
Payakan.

01:29:29.238 --> 01:29:30.323
-What?
-It's Payakan.

01:29:30.406 --> 01:29:31.407
Who's Payakan?

01:29:32.075 --> 01:29:33.743
A young bull
who went rogue.

01:29:33.910 --> 01:29:35.495
He's outcast.
Alone.

01:29:36.037 --> 01:29:37.163
And he has
a missing fin.

01:29:37.330 --> 01:29:38.831
They say
he is a killer.

01:29:38.998 --> 01:29:40.875
-No, no.
-He killed Na'vi,

01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:42.919
and other tulkun.

01:29:44.379 --> 01:29:46.172
Not here,
but far to the south.

01:29:46.339 --> 01:29:48.257
-No, he's no killer.
-Lo'ak,

01:29:49.050 --> 01:29:50.551
you are lucky to be alive.

01:29:50.718 --> 01:29:52.053
I'm telling you guys.

01:29:52.136 --> 01:29:53.262
He saved my life.

01:29:53.971 --> 01:29:55.056
He's my friend.

01:29:55.681 --> 01:29:56.849
My baby bro!

01:29:57.016 --> 01:29:58.059
The Mighty Warrior

01:29:58.601 --> 01:29:59.602
who faced the killer tulkun,

01:29:59.685 --> 01:30:00.686
and lived
to tell about it, huh?

01:30:03.189 --> 01:30:04.273
You guys
aren't listening.

01:30:04.816 --> 01:30:06.526
Lo'ak, I'm listening.

01:30:06.609 --> 01:30:08.277
Lo'ak, come back.

01:30:08.444 --> 01:30:09.737
You skxawngs.

01:30:10.863 --> 01:30:12.532
Payakan!

01:30:13.950 --> 01:30:14.992
Payakan!

01:30:17.370 --> 01:30:19.122
Payakan!

01:30:27.088 --> 01:30:29.132
It's good to see you.

01:30:31.426 --> 01:30:33.052
Why are you outcast?

01:30:33.219 --> 01:30:34.220
What happened?

01:30:35.513 --> 01:30:38.266
It's too painful.

01:30:40.101 --> 01:30:42.353
I trust you.

01:30:42.937 --> 01:30:44.981
You can trust me.

01:30:45.064 --> 01:30:46.858
I trust you.

01:31:30.860 --> 01:31:32.069
Bro, that's disgusting!

01:31:36.407 --> 01:31:37.992
Go faster!

01:31:51.255 --> 01:31:52.340
Whoo-hoo!

01:31:57.303 --> 01:31:58.554
Whoo-hoo!

01:32:13.694 --> 01:32:14.904
We are here.

01:32:21.536 --> 01:32:23.663
This is the Cove
of the Ancestors.

01:32:23.829 --> 01:32:25.373
Our most sacred place.

01:32:32.463 --> 01:32:35.341
Eclipse is the best
time of day to be here.

01:32:48.729 --> 01:32:49.730
This is it.

01:32:50.314 --> 01:32:51.649
This is the Spirit Tree.

01:33:58.507 --> 01:33:59.967
My beautiful daughter.

01:34:01.510 --> 01:34:02.511
Hi, Ma.

01:34:03.471 --> 01:34:04.722
I'm so happy
to see you.

01:34:05.806 --> 01:34:06.807
But you look troubled.

01:34:10.436 --> 01:34:12.271
Oh.

01:34:13.272 --> 01:34:14.273
My sweet girl.

01:34:15.191 --> 01:34:16.567
It will be okay.

01:34:24.116 --> 01:34:25.284
What is it, baby?

01:34:26.702 --> 01:34:28.037
Why am I different?

01:34:30.706 --> 01:34:32.917
What does the Great Mother
want from me?

01:34:36.545 --> 01:34:38.506
Who was my father?

01:34:41.050 --> 01:34:42.051
Oh...

01:34:42.134 --> 01:34:44.220
Oh, my darling.

01:34:48.974 --> 01:34:50.226
No!

01:35:08.452 --> 01:35:10.329
-Come on.
-Kiri!

01:35:11.789 --> 01:35:12.790
Kiri!

01:35:15.501 --> 01:35:16.836
What is wrong?
What is it?

01:35:17.670 --> 01:35:18.754
It was a seizure.

01:35:19.380 --> 01:35:20.756
Is she breathing?

01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:21.966
Is she breathing?

01:35:25.553 --> 01:35:27.471
Get her to the village!
Hurry!

01:35:27.596 --> 01:35:28.764
Let's go!
Let's move!

01:35:28.848 --> 01:35:30.141
Tuk, come.

01:35:44.822 --> 01:35:46.073
-Hi!
-It's good to see you.

01:35:46.198 --> 01:35:47.324
Let's get the gear.
Neteyam!

01:35:47.450 --> 01:35:48.534
Neteyam,
keep them back!

01:35:48.617 --> 01:35:49.618
How is she?

01:35:49.702 --> 01:35:50.828
She's still unconscious.

01:35:51.245 --> 01:35:52.955
There's no bleed.

01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:54.165
There's no fracture.

01:35:55.207 --> 01:35:56.792
No effects of hypoxia.

01:35:56.959 --> 01:35:58.002
The brain looks good.

01:36:02.715 --> 01:36:04.383
But we still have
this interictal activity

01:36:04.467 --> 01:36:06.010
right here in the prefrontal.
Okay.

01:36:06.093 --> 01:36:07.678
She's definitely
had a seizure.

01:36:07.762 --> 01:36:09.013
I think we can
rule out toxins.

01:36:09.096 --> 01:36:10.181
So what is it?

01:36:10.264 --> 01:36:11.265
Until this point...

01:36:11.348 --> 01:36:13.100
I see that
I am not needed here.

01:36:13.559 --> 01:36:14.977
You are Tsahik!

01:36:16.854 --> 01:36:18.147
Remove these things.

01:36:19.064 --> 01:36:20.900
Out! You have done nothing!

01:36:21.025 --> 01:36:22.193
Come on, come on.
Let's just take a break.

01:36:22.276 --> 01:36:23.277
In the middle...

01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:24.779
Okay, hold on.
I gotta take her IV off.

01:36:26.489 --> 01:36:27.490
Tuktirey.

01:36:35.998 --> 01:36:38.125
She said that
she can feel Eywa.

01:36:38.209 --> 01:36:39.460
She can hear her heartbeat.

01:36:39.543 --> 01:36:40.544
-That's it.
-What?

01:36:40.628 --> 01:36:42.838
That is classic
frontal lobe epilepsy.

01:36:43.506 --> 01:36:44.590
-Epilepsy?
-Yep.

01:36:44.673 --> 01:36:46.717
You see visions.
You get

01:36:46.884 --> 01:36:47.885
states of religious ecstasy

01:36:47.968 --> 01:36:49.178
like the kind
she's describing.

01:36:57.394 --> 01:37:00.815
Pluggin' into the Spirit Tree
is some sort of a trigger.

01:37:00.981 --> 01:37:02.775
You definitely can't let her
do that anymore.

01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:06.153
What? Ever?

01:37:06.237 --> 01:37:07.238
Jake.

01:37:07.822 --> 01:37:09.657
If she seizes
underwater again,

01:37:10.324 --> 01:37:11.534
it could kill her.

01:37:21.585 --> 01:37:23.045
Kiri!

01:37:23.128 --> 01:37:25.005
You're awake!

01:37:30.886 --> 01:37:32.596
Oh, Kiri.

01:37:34.014 --> 01:37:35.516
Kiri, my sweet child.

01:37:36.350 --> 01:37:37.893
Oh, my sweet little girl.

01:37:38.644 --> 01:37:39.645
Okay, this one.

01:37:39.728 --> 01:37:40.729
"I See you."

01:37:41.939 --> 01:37:43.566
Oel ngati kameie.

01:37:44.024 --> 01:37:45.943
Ngaati. Ngaati!

01:37:47.027 --> 01:37:48.279
That's what I just said,
isn't it?

01:37:48.737 --> 01:37:50.364
Oel ngati kameie.

01:37:50.447 --> 01:37:52.658
Not "Naati. Ngaati."

01:37:52.741 --> 01:37:53.951
Ngaati, ngaati.

01:37:54.034 --> 01:37:56.287
All right. Like comin' out
your nose or something.

01:37:56.370 --> 01:37:58.163
Boss,

01:37:58.914 --> 01:38:00.791
long-range patrol
picked up a radar hit.

01:38:00.958 --> 01:38:02.251
A rogue gunship.

01:38:03.294 --> 01:38:04.295
Where?

01:38:04.461 --> 01:38:06.046
Eastern sea.
Four hundred klicks north.

01:38:07.882 --> 01:38:08.883
Uh-huh.

01:38:08.966 --> 01:38:10.676
Hang on.

01:38:12.636 --> 01:38:14.430
The signal was intermittent,

01:38:14.513 --> 01:38:16.724
and they lost it
over open water but...

01:38:17.391 --> 01:38:18.851
if you project the track,

01:38:20.144 --> 01:38:21.896
it hits this island group.

01:38:23.063 --> 01:38:24.940
That's hundreds
of islands.

01:38:25.107 --> 01:38:27.192
That's a big search box
with lots of villages.

01:38:27.359 --> 01:38:28.444
This is our guy.

01:38:29.278 --> 01:38:30.571
You give me ships
and aircraft,

01:38:30.654 --> 01:38:32.323
I'll bring you back his scalp.

01:38:44.418 --> 01:38:45.419
Bogies inbound.

01:38:45.502 --> 01:38:46.503
Skipper.

01:38:54.762 --> 01:38:56.305
-All stop.
-All stop.

01:38:56.430 --> 01:38:57.681
All stop. Aye.

01:39:16.742 --> 01:39:17.785
Hey.

01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:19.370
You Scoresby?

01:39:19.495 --> 01:39:20.704
Uh-huh.

01:39:20.788 --> 01:39:23.666
Are you the asshole
who's commandeering my ship?

01:39:24.249 --> 01:39:26.210
That would be me.

01:39:27.002 --> 01:39:30.005
The target's pretty much
this whole island group.

01:39:30.798 --> 01:39:31.966
Never been up there.

01:39:33.217 --> 01:39:35.678
You know those waters, doc.
What kinda indigenous we got?

01:39:35.761 --> 01:39:37.554
Uh, Metkayina, mostly.

01:39:37.638 --> 01:39:39.807
Some Ta'unui.
Maybe fifty villages.

01:39:39.932 --> 01:39:41.350
And you are who?

01:39:41.892 --> 01:39:43.769
Oh. Uh, I'm Ian Garvin.

01:39:45.104 --> 01:39:46.522
Marine biologist.

01:39:46.605 --> 01:39:48.524
Fifty villages.
A hundred villages.

01:39:48.607 --> 01:39:50.192
I don't care.
We'll search 'em all.

01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:52.653
I hunt tulkun.

01:39:53.362 --> 01:39:55.698
That's what I'm rigged for.
That's all my guys do.

01:39:55.781 --> 01:39:57.366
I've got quotas to meet.

01:39:58.575 --> 01:40:00.494
I'll be nice once.

01:40:01.245 --> 01:40:03.163
Then I won't.

01:40:05.457 --> 01:40:06.917
Well, if you can't
get out of it,

01:40:08.168 --> 01:40:09.169
get into it!

01:40:10.045 --> 01:40:12.464
-All crews to stations!
-Hey, don't touch.

01:40:14.925 --> 01:40:16.510
Helm, bring her up.
Flight speed.

01:40:16.677 --> 01:40:17.928
Flight speed, aye.

01:40:28.731 --> 01:40:30.024
What was that?

01:40:30.107 --> 01:40:32.067
-- They're coming!
-- What's going on?

01:40:35.529 --> 01:40:37.322
The tulkun have returned!

01:40:37.489 --> 01:40:40.534
Everybody, our Brothers
and Sisters have returned.

01:40:50.753 --> 01:40:52.963
In their endless cycle
of migration,

01:40:53.255 --> 01:40:54.798
the tulkun had come home.

01:40:56.925 --> 01:40:58.761
I See you!

01:41:01.138 --> 01:41:02.139
Kiri!

01:41:02.514 --> 01:41:03.932
Kiri, come on. Come on!

01:41:04.099 --> 01:41:05.392
Tuk, leave me alone.

01:41:05.476 --> 01:41:06.769
-Come on!
-What?

01:41:07.728 --> 01:41:09.646
What do you want?

01:41:09.980 --> 01:41:11.607
Look. Look.

01:41:19.531 --> 01:41:20.616
Come on.

01:41:21.408 --> 01:41:22.534
Let's go meet them.

01:41:23.118 --> 01:41:24.119
Look,

01:41:24.203 --> 01:41:25.621
it's my Spirit Sister.

01:42:22.511 --> 01:42:25.389
Sister, I See you.

01:42:26.181 --> 01:42:28.809
I See you, Sister. I am happy.

01:42:34.731 --> 01:42:37.943
Your son is beautiful.

01:42:38.610 --> 01:42:41.196
Thank you. How is your baby?

01:42:42.239 --> 01:42:44.575
My baby is strong.

01:42:47.452 --> 01:42:48.745
I met a boy.

01:42:48.871 --> 01:42:50.455
It was
a time for stories.

01:42:51.665 --> 01:42:52.916
Of their season apart.

01:42:53.750 --> 01:42:55.169
Of deaths and births.

01:42:57.629 --> 01:42:58.672
Of old friends

01:42:58.755 --> 01:42:59.756
and new loves.

01:43:16.106 --> 01:43:18.734
TA'UNUI VILLAGE

01:43:19.359 --> 01:43:20.819
Children.

01:43:23.530 --> 01:43:24.531
Be calm,

01:43:24.615 --> 01:43:25.657
my people.

01:43:26.116 --> 01:43:28.243
We're looking
for weapons, comms.

01:43:28.327 --> 01:43:29.536
Any kind of tech.

01:43:29.786 --> 01:43:30.787
Get down.

01:43:30.871 --> 01:43:32.289
You too.
You see this?

01:43:32.372 --> 01:43:33.457
Get down

01:43:33.624 --> 01:43:35.125
Stay down and shut up!

01:43:38.045 --> 01:43:39.129
This man...

01:43:39.713 --> 01:43:43.091
We know he is in these islands.

01:43:43.884 --> 01:43:44.885
Here? This village?

01:43:46.261 --> 01:43:47.846
We are a totally separate clan...

01:43:48.096 --> 01:43:49.806
...this man in the reflection...

01:43:49.890 --> 01:43:51.433
...is from the forest.

01:43:51.516 --> 01:43:52.643
Now what's he saying?

01:43:52.726 --> 01:43:53.727
They never saw him.

01:43:53.810 --> 01:43:54.811
These are Sea People.

01:43:54.895 --> 01:43:56.521
Forest People
don't come here.

01:43:56.688 --> 01:43:58.232
I ain't buyin' that.

01:44:03.528 --> 01:44:05.572
He needs to leave here...

01:44:05.781 --> 01:44:07.324
and go to the forest to find this man.

01:44:10.118 --> 01:44:11.662
They don't know anything.

01:44:14.498 --> 01:44:15.499
Shoot that animal.

01:44:19.378 --> 01:44:20.545
What the hell are you doing?

01:44:26.969 --> 01:44:28.053
Down!

01:44:29.638 --> 01:44:30.639
Be calm.

01:44:31.682 --> 01:44:33.058
Hey, your ears workin' now?

01:44:33.141 --> 01:44:34.268
Be calm!

01:44:34.559 --> 01:44:36.270
You see
what these can do, huh?

01:44:38.605 --> 01:44:39.731
Jake Sully.

01:44:40.899 --> 01:44:43.360
Toruk Makto!

01:44:43.527 --> 01:44:44.903
He told you he doesn't know!

01:44:45.070 --> 01:44:46.947
-Put her down!
-Get down!

01:44:48.657 --> 01:44:49.700
Get down!

01:44:49.908 --> 01:44:50.909
Stop!

01:44:50.993 --> 01:44:51.994
Stop!

01:44:52.077 --> 01:44:53.620
You make it
real clear to him.

01:44:54.204 --> 01:44:55.330
He doesn't give up Sully,

01:44:55.872 --> 01:44:57.374
we kill the Tsahik.

01:44:57.541 --> 01:44:58.875
No, I'm not doin' that.

01:44:59.001 --> 01:45:00.002
Is that right?

01:45:00.627 --> 01:45:02.254
I'm not gonna be
a part of this!

01:45:02.337 --> 01:45:03.630
Get down!

01:45:03.797 --> 01:45:05.215
These people
don't know anything!

01:45:05.382 --> 01:45:06.591
They don't know anything!

01:45:06.758 --> 01:45:08.677
-- Don't move!
-- Stay down.

01:45:08.760 --> 01:45:10.721
Shut up!

01:45:12.347 --> 01:45:13.348
We really
gonna waste her?

01:45:14.516 --> 01:45:15.517
Please.

01:45:15.684 --> 01:45:16.935
Please don't do this.

01:45:17.019 --> 01:45:18.020
This is wrong.

01:45:18.186 --> 01:45:20.272
What you're doing here
is wrong.

01:45:21.315 --> 01:45:22.316
Please.

01:45:27.571 --> 01:45:28.780
Burn the hooches.

01:45:29.781 --> 01:45:31.283
Hey, light 'em up.

01:45:31.450 --> 01:45:32.826
Light 'em up. All of 'em!

01:45:33.410 --> 01:45:34.995
-- Flamethrowers up!
-- Light 'em up.

01:45:45.964 --> 01:45:47.257
I'm sorry!

01:45:47.799 --> 01:45:49.384
I didn't know!

01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:51.345
Stop this madness!

01:45:52.012 --> 01:45:53.388
I'm sorry.

01:45:53.555 --> 01:45:56.099
We're outta here.

01:45:56.475 --> 01:45:57.601
Don't touch me!

01:45:58.018 --> 01:45:59.019
I'm sorry.

01:45:59.102 --> 01:46:00.395
Let's go.

01:46:00.479 --> 01:46:01.980
-Saddle up.
-All right. Let's go.

01:46:26.963 --> 01:46:27.964
What's wrong?

01:46:28.131 --> 01:46:29.341
Sky People.

01:46:30.967 --> 01:46:32.803
They're looking for you,
Jakesully.

01:46:33.220 --> 01:46:34.221
South.

01:46:34.304 --> 01:46:37.182
They have a human boy
who speaks Na'vi.

01:46:41.228 --> 01:46:42.729
Did they kill anybody?

01:46:43.438 --> 01:46:44.815
Not yet.

01:46:46.108 --> 01:46:47.192
They threaten.

01:46:47.609 --> 01:46:50.070
But the villagers will not
tell them where you are.

01:46:50.404 --> 01:46:51.488
By my order.

01:46:59.454 --> 01:47:01.873
We must hunt
this demon.

01:47:02.040 --> 01:47:03.083
Trap him.

01:47:03.250 --> 01:47:04.251
Kill him.

01:47:05.127 --> 01:47:06.920
We've gotta be smart.

01:47:07.254 --> 01:47:08.630
We gotta be smart.

01:47:08.713 --> 01:47:09.714
If we hit Quaritch,

01:47:09.923 --> 01:47:11.842
they're gonna know
where we are,

01:47:11.925 --> 01:47:13.802
and they're gonna come here
with everything they've got.

01:47:15.637 --> 01:47:16.972
Then what is our plan?

01:47:18.682 --> 01:47:19.933
That's Toruk Makto!

01:47:20.058 --> 01:47:21.393
Head down.

01:47:21.810 --> 01:47:23.019
Has he been here?

01:47:27.816 --> 01:47:29.025
This shit ain't workin'.

01:47:29.860 --> 01:47:31.111
Nah, they're stonewallin' us.

01:47:31.903 --> 01:47:33.071
If we turn up the heat,

01:47:33.155 --> 01:47:34.948
he's just gonna keep runnin'.

01:47:35.240 --> 01:47:37.742
We gotta draw him out.

01:47:46.168 --> 01:47:47.252
I'm over it.

01:47:48.462 --> 01:47:50.630
I've got quotas to meet.

01:47:50.797 --> 01:47:52.382
You wanna hunt?

01:47:52.757 --> 01:47:54.009
Let's hunt.

01:47:54.801 --> 01:47:56.303
-Come on.
-Here? Not here.

01:47:56.428 --> 01:47:57.721
There's too many villages.

01:47:57.804 --> 01:47:59.306
No.
No, no, no.

01:48:00.599 --> 01:48:02.017
Respectfully, sir, uh,

01:48:02.434 --> 01:48:03.435
you do not understand

01:48:03.518 --> 01:48:04.519
the kinship bonds

01:48:04.603 --> 01:48:06.354
between the tulkun
and the ocean Na'vi.

01:48:06.438 --> 01:48:08.690
It would be like murdering
a member of their family.

01:48:08.815 --> 01:48:10.108
If we start hunting here,

01:48:10.275 --> 01:48:12.402
the hostiles
will come after us.

01:48:12.569 --> 01:48:13.695
Exactly.

01:48:14.362 --> 01:48:16.406
One hostile in particular.

01:48:26.791 --> 01:48:28.460
I know how you feel.

01:48:31.213 --> 01:48:34.174
I feel all alone too.

01:48:36.134 --> 01:48:37.427
Tell me.

01:48:37.594 --> 01:48:39.221
Why are you outcast?

01:51:02.072 --> 01:51:03.948
I'm sorry.

01:51:04.115 --> 01:51:05.575
I'm so sorry.

01:51:09.579 --> 01:51:10.580
It's okay.

01:51:11.247 --> 01:51:12.248
It's okay.

01:51:26.721 --> 01:51:28.306
You allowed this.

01:51:29.724 --> 01:51:32.894
You allowed him to bond
with the outcast!

01:51:36.272 --> 01:51:37.691
Tsireya.

01:51:38.650 --> 01:51:40.276
You disappoint me, daughter.

01:51:41.569 --> 01:51:42.821
And you,

01:51:42.987 --> 01:51:44.322
son of a great warrior,

01:51:44.447 --> 01:51:45.949
who has been taught better.

01:51:46.116 --> 01:51:47.701
Payakan saved my life, sir.

01:51:47.784 --> 01:51:48.785
You don't know him.

01:51:48.952 --> 01:51:50.286
No, Lo'ak.

01:51:51.371 --> 01:51:52.372
Sit.

01:51:53.790 --> 01:51:55.041
Sit.

01:51:57.919 --> 01:51:59.295
Sit down!

01:52:03.383 --> 01:52:04.884
Hear my words, boy.

01:52:06.803 --> 01:52:09.180
In the days
of the First Songs,

01:52:09.556 --> 01:52:11.975
tulkun fought
amongst themselves,

01:52:12.100 --> 01:52:14.144
for territory,

01:52:14.310 --> 01:52:15.645
and for revenge.

01:52:16.646 --> 01:52:18.523
But they came to believe

01:52:18.690 --> 01:52:21.276
that killing,
no matter how justified,

01:52:21.443 --> 01:52:24.112
only brings more killing.

01:52:25.947 --> 01:52:29.200
So all killing
was forbidden.

01:52:29.409 --> 01:52:32.203
This is the Tulkun Way.

01:52:33.413 --> 01:52:34.414
Payakan

01:52:35.331 --> 01:52:37.500
is a killer, so,

01:52:37.584 --> 01:52:39.544
he is outcast.

01:52:39.711 --> 01:52:41.629
I'm sorry, sir.
But you're wrong.

01:52:41.796 --> 01:52:42.839
Lo'ak.

01:52:43.631 --> 01:52:44.758
You speak
to Olo'eyktan!

01:52:44.841 --> 01:52:46.718
-I know what I...
-That's enough!

01:52:51.055 --> 01:52:53.099
I know what I know.

01:52:55.643 --> 01:52:56.895
That's enough.

01:52:58.688 --> 01:53:00.440
I'll deal with this one.

01:53:06.613 --> 01:53:08.072
This storm will pass.

01:53:09.616 --> 01:53:13.661
Lo'ak, I saw
something today.

01:53:13.745 --> 01:53:15.371
I saw a Forest Boy

01:53:15.455 --> 01:53:16.873
chosen by tulkun.

01:53:17.791 --> 01:53:20.335
I am very proud of you.

01:53:20.502 --> 01:53:22.295
Payakan didn't kill
those boys.

01:53:23.087 --> 01:53:24.088
I saw it all.

01:53:24.255 --> 01:53:25.590
The demon ship
killed his mother

01:53:25.673 --> 01:53:26.966
right in front of him.

01:53:27.050 --> 01:53:29.177
He gathered the young bulls
and the reef boys together

01:53:29.260 --> 01:53:30.512
to attack the ship.

01:53:31.179 --> 01:53:33.097
And they were all killed,

01:53:33.556 --> 01:53:35.475
but by the Sky People.
Not by him.

01:53:35.642 --> 01:53:37.477
-He's not a killer.
-No, Lo'ak.

01:53:37.644 --> 01:53:39.979
By the Tulkun Way, he is.

01:53:40.146 --> 01:53:41.231
He bears those deaths.

01:53:41.397 --> 01:53:43.775
Does he have to pay for it
for the rest of his life?

01:53:43.942 --> 01:53:45.068
He knows
what he did was wrong.

01:53:45.151 --> 01:53:46.319
He would never do it again.

01:53:48.071 --> 01:53:49.072
We must tell my father...

01:53:49.155 --> 01:53:50.156
No. No.

01:53:50.240 --> 01:53:51.491
I'm in enough trouble
with my dad already.

01:53:51.658 --> 01:53:52.951
Your father
will understand this.

01:53:53.034 --> 01:53:54.035
No, he won't.

01:53:54.536 --> 01:53:56.454
He doesn't
understand anything.

01:53:56.621 --> 01:53:58.248
The whole clan
hates me.

01:53:58.414 --> 01:53:59.624
Demon blood.

01:53:59.791 --> 01:54:01.626
Alien.
That's all they see.

01:54:07.841 --> 01:54:09.634
I See you.

01:54:13.888 --> 01:54:16.474
You are Brother of Tulkun.

01:54:18.726 --> 01:54:20.687
You are one of us now.

01:54:37.871 --> 01:54:38.872
You got my mother?

01:54:39.038 --> 01:54:41.708
Mother and calf.
Strong signal. Range 4,000.

01:54:41.791 --> 01:54:42.792
Bring it down,

01:54:42.917 --> 01:54:43.918
on the hull.

01:54:44.002 --> 01:54:45.253
-Comin' down, aye.
-Whoo!

01:54:45.420 --> 01:54:46.421
Foils deployed.

01:55:08.735 --> 01:55:10.320
Sub teams,
two minutes!

01:55:10.403 --> 01:55:11.905
Let's get in there!

01:55:12.071 --> 01:55:14.073
Hatches closed!

01:55:14.240 --> 01:55:16.159
Come on, hustle! Hustle!

01:55:16.326 --> 01:55:18.202
Crews to their boats.
Two minutes.

01:55:18.369 --> 01:55:19.621
Let's make some bank.

01:55:20.788 --> 01:55:22.081
Boat crews!

01:55:22.248 --> 01:55:24.834
Let's get those tie downs off!
Tie downs off!

01:55:30.131 --> 01:55:31.966
All boats in! Boats in!

01:55:36.596 --> 01:55:38.056
Let's go, baby!

01:55:48.942 --> 01:55:50.151
We're rollin'!

01:55:56.741 --> 01:55:58.284
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

01:56:00.703 --> 01:56:02.372
Whoo!

01:56:16.511 --> 01:56:17.971
Stand by depth charges,

01:56:18.054 --> 01:56:20.139
and fire, fire, fire!

01:56:36.072 --> 01:56:37.073
Ho!

01:56:42.286 --> 01:56:43.287
What's that?

01:56:43.371 --> 01:56:44.414
What are they doin'?

01:56:44.914 --> 01:56:47.083
Those are
echolocation sensors.

01:56:47.583 --> 01:56:48.918
How they navigate.

01:56:49.085 --> 01:56:50.837
They have to hold
them out of the water,

01:56:51.004 --> 01:56:52.088
or they'll go deaf.

01:56:53.089 --> 01:56:54.090
Picadors!

01:56:54.465 --> 01:56:55.717
Get in there! Go on.

01:56:55.800 --> 01:56:57.593
Get in there.
Get up in there!

01:57:13.651 --> 01:57:15.903
They're gonna cut the cow
from the rest of the pod

01:57:16.070 --> 01:57:17.739
using the sound cannon.

01:57:17.905 --> 01:57:20.575
They target the mother
because the calf swims slowly,

01:57:20.658 --> 01:57:22.910
and she won't leave the calf.

01:57:23.327 --> 01:57:24.954
Do they ever fight back?

01:57:25.121 --> 01:57:27.498
Nah, never seen 'em
lift a fin.

01:57:28.124 --> 01:57:30.501
Tough bastards to kill though.

01:57:31.335 --> 01:57:32.920
Sub teams, go!

01:57:33.463 --> 01:57:34.505
And release.

01:57:38.468 --> 01:57:40.178
Release, release.

01:57:44.849 --> 01:57:45.850
There's our gal.

01:57:45.933 --> 01:57:47.560
Target in sight.

01:57:47.643 --> 01:57:49.103
3-6 is in hot
with harpoons.

01:57:49.270 --> 01:57:50.438
Here we go, baby.

01:57:51.898 --> 01:57:53.858
See, we go in from below

01:57:53.983 --> 01:57:55.818
where there's gaps
in the armor.

01:57:59.697 --> 01:58:01.282
All right, let's go.
Get up in there.

01:58:01.365 --> 01:58:02.366
I'm goin' in.

01:58:02.450 --> 01:58:03.534
Get me in close.

01:58:07.455 --> 01:58:08.456
Hold her steady.

01:58:08.623 --> 01:58:10.166
In range.
Arm one.

01:58:10.333 --> 01:58:12.001
Arming, target lock.

01:58:12.168 --> 01:58:13.294
And one away.

01:58:19.634 --> 01:58:20.927
Two's in hot.

01:58:21.010 --> 01:58:22.220
-Arm one.
-Arming.

01:58:22.386 --> 01:58:23.429
Fire.

01:58:27.600 --> 01:58:29.060
-Good strike. Arm two.
-Arming.

01:58:29.227 --> 01:58:30.353
Two away.

01:58:31.687 --> 01:58:32.772
Booyah!

01:58:32.855 --> 01:58:33.856
Nice.

01:58:33.940 --> 01:58:35.566
3-6, you owe us a beer.

01:58:40.363 --> 01:58:42.365
You see, the bags
slow her down

01:58:42.532 --> 01:58:43.783
and keep her up
at the surface.

01:58:43.950 --> 01:58:44.951
Yeah.

01:58:45.118 --> 01:58:46.244
Get on her!

01:58:46.410 --> 01:58:47.703
Get me in there.

01:58:47.870 --> 01:58:49.247
Straight up on her.

01:58:49.497 --> 01:58:50.498
30 meters.

01:58:51.374 --> 01:58:52.959
Explosive-tipped harpoon.

01:58:53.501 --> 01:58:56.170
Ten meters. Get me in there.
Put me in the pocket.

01:58:56.671 --> 01:58:57.839
Now steady, steady.

01:58:57.922 --> 01:58:58.965
Stay with her.

01:58:59.298 --> 01:59:00.883
Hold. Hold.

01:59:03.052 --> 01:59:04.262
Line's runnin'!

01:59:11.102 --> 01:59:13.229
Hold on to your ponytail,
Colonel!

01:59:14.689 --> 01:59:16.023
Oh. Whoa-ho!

01:59:24.073 --> 01:59:25.241
Hold back full!

01:59:25.408 --> 01:59:26.742
Back full, aye.

01:59:33.416 --> 01:59:34.584
Hold her.

01:59:34.750 --> 01:59:35.877
Hold her.

01:59:39.172 --> 01:59:41.841
She takes an explosive harpoon
to the chest,

01:59:41.966 --> 01:59:43.384
and she's still runnin'.

01:59:44.302 --> 01:59:45.928
Beautiful.

01:59:57.648 --> 01:59:58.649
Whoo!

02:00:59.794 --> 02:01:02.588
The only way to reach
the gland is from below.

02:01:02.672 --> 02:01:04.966
We drill up
through the hard palate

02:01:05.883 --> 02:01:07.885
into the brain. And...

02:01:11.681 --> 02:01:13.933
These are highly
intelligent beings.

02:01:14.100 --> 02:01:15.101
Probably smarter than us.

02:01:15.226 --> 02:01:16.477
Not smarter than me.

02:01:16.644 --> 02:01:18.104
That is setting
the bar very low.

02:01:18.271 --> 02:01:19.814
Hey, I'm the one
with the harpoon.

02:01:21.399 --> 02:01:22.400
Yep.

02:01:33.494 --> 02:01:34.495
How do you know?

02:01:34.662 --> 02:01:35.913
That they're smarter than us?

02:01:36.747 --> 02:01:38.416
More neurons, more pathways.

02:01:39.292 --> 02:01:40.668
Not only are they smarter,

02:01:40.751 --> 02:01:42.837
they're deeply emotional.

02:01:43.671 --> 02:01:44.922
More spiritual.

02:01:48.759 --> 02:01:50.136
See, this region here

02:01:50.219 --> 02:01:52.263
corresponds with
our emotional centers,

02:01:52.346 --> 02:01:54.807
but proportionally
it's much larger.

02:01:56.267 --> 02:01:57.810
They have music,

02:01:57.977 --> 02:01:59.520
philosophy,

02:01:59.687 --> 02:02:01.272
mathematics,

02:02:01.772 --> 02:02:03.107
complex language.

02:02:03.316 --> 02:02:04.317
Okay.

02:02:05.109 --> 02:02:06.235
Here we go.

02:02:07.028 --> 02:02:08.404
Show me the money.

02:02:13.117 --> 02:02:15.119
So that's what
this is all about?

02:02:15.745 --> 02:02:17.079
That's it.

02:02:17.246 --> 02:02:18.247
Amrita.

02:02:21.167 --> 02:02:23.085
Bad luck for the big guys.

02:02:23.252 --> 02:02:26.505
This stuff just happens
to stop human aging. Like...

02:02:27.089 --> 02:02:28.466
stops it.

02:02:30.968 --> 02:02:33.137
Ounce for ounce
the single most valuable

02:02:33.304 --> 02:02:35.264
substance known to man.

02:02:36.974 --> 02:02:38.976
This little vial here
is worth like,

02:02:40.144 --> 02:02:41.395
80 million.

02:02:42.438 --> 02:02:43.439
Think fast!

02:02:44.023 --> 02:02:45.775
Please don't.

02:02:47.068 --> 02:02:48.069
It's never funny.

02:02:48.152 --> 02:02:49.695
Amrita is what's paying

02:02:49.779 --> 02:02:52.156
for everything here
on Pandora now.

02:02:53.115 --> 02:02:55.534
Even your research.
Ain't that right, Dr. G?

02:02:55.701 --> 02:02:56.994
It's why I drink.

02:02:59.413 --> 02:03:00.498
That's all you take?

02:03:00.915 --> 02:03:03.834
I mean,
you just waste the rest?

02:03:05.378 --> 02:03:06.962
Drop the bags.

02:03:07.421 --> 02:03:08.714
Let's sink her!

02:03:08.881 --> 02:03:10.966
No. Leave the bags.

02:03:11.342 --> 02:03:13.135
I want 'em to know it was us.

02:03:13.803 --> 02:03:17.181
I charge extra
for bein' used as bait.

02:03:51.465 --> 02:03:53.968
Her name is Ro'a.

02:03:56.345 --> 02:03:59.181
She was my Spirit Sister.

02:04:01.559 --> 02:04:04.311
She was a composer of songs.

02:04:04.478 --> 02:04:05.771
Much revered.

02:04:05.855 --> 02:04:07.314
We would sing together.

02:04:08.858 --> 02:04:12.528
She waited many breeding
cycles to have this calf.

02:04:13.028 --> 02:04:15.281
The clan were
so happy for her.

02:04:17.825 --> 02:04:20.327
What is this, Tonowari?

02:04:23.080 --> 02:04:24.748
What is this?

02:04:44.310 --> 02:04:47.229
My Spirit Sister
and her baby

02:04:47.396 --> 02:04:49.940
have been murdered
by the Sky People!

02:04:51.275 --> 02:04:53.486
This war has come to us.

02:04:54.320 --> 02:04:55.821
We knew
about this hunting

02:04:55.988 --> 02:04:57.740
of our tulkun people.

02:04:57.907 --> 02:04:59.283
But it was
over the horizon,

02:04:59.533 --> 02:05:00.659
far away.

02:05:00.993 --> 02:05:02.786
Now it is here!

02:05:06.540 --> 02:05:07.541
No, you don't...

02:05:07.708 --> 02:05:09.835
You gotta understand
how the Sky People think.

02:05:10.002 --> 02:05:11.712
They don't care
about the Great Balance.

02:05:11.879 --> 02:05:13.422
We don't answer
to Sky People!

02:05:13.589 --> 02:05:15.424
Listen. Listen to him.

02:05:15.591 --> 02:05:16.717
The Sky People
are not gonna stop.

02:05:16.800 --> 02:05:17.885
This is only
the beginning.

02:05:17.968 --> 02:05:20.012
You gotta tell
your tulkun to leave.

02:05:21.180 --> 02:05:23.182
You gotta tell them
to go far away!

02:05:23.432 --> 02:05:24.600
Leave?

02:05:25.267 --> 02:05:27.311
You live among us,

02:05:28.270 --> 02:05:30.064
and you learn nothing!

02:05:30.189 --> 02:05:33.359
We will fight to protect
our brothers and sisters!

02:05:33.526 --> 02:05:34.652
No, no, no.

02:05:36.320 --> 02:05:37.404
If you attack,

02:05:37.571 --> 02:05:39.281
if you fight,

02:05:39.448 --> 02:05:40.699
then they will destroy you!

02:05:40.783 --> 02:05:41.784
They will destroy

02:05:41.867 --> 02:05:42.952
everything that you love.

02:05:43.035 --> 02:05:44.537
No!

02:05:44.662 --> 02:05:46.121
-You hear my words!
-We will fight! We will fight!

02:05:46.455 --> 02:05:47.456
Hear my words!

02:05:47.623 --> 02:05:48.624
Stay calm.

02:05:48.791 --> 02:05:50.167
Stay calm!

02:05:50.251 --> 02:05:51.252
Listen to my father.

02:05:51.335 --> 02:05:52.336
Damn it!

02:05:52.503 --> 02:05:53.754
He speaks the truth.

02:06:03.764 --> 02:06:05.099
You tell the tulkun

02:06:06.892 --> 02:06:08.352
that if they're hit
by one of these,

02:06:08.477 --> 02:06:09.645
they're marked for death.

02:06:12.565 --> 02:06:13.566
And call for me,

02:06:13.732 --> 02:06:14.942
I'll silence it.

02:06:17.611 --> 02:06:19.530
Saving their lives,
that's all that matters.

02:06:20.573 --> 02:06:21.907
Right?

02:06:24.410 --> 02:06:26.078
Saving your family.

02:06:38.966 --> 02:06:40.175
Tell the tulkun.

02:06:41.468 --> 02:06:42.886
Go.

02:06:42.970 --> 02:06:43.971
Go!

02:06:47.600 --> 02:06:49.268
We must fight.

02:06:50.394 --> 02:06:51.979
MaJake.

02:06:52.146 --> 02:06:53.731
I will not stand
and do nothing!

02:06:54.565 --> 02:06:56.775
It's a trap.
They want us to hit back.

02:06:57.526 --> 02:06:59.111
They're not hunting tulkun.

02:06:59.278 --> 02:07:00.779
They're hunting us.

02:07:15.336 --> 02:07:17.254
No way you're rolling
out of here, baby brother.

02:07:17.421 --> 02:07:19.006
I have to warn Payakan
about the pingers.

02:07:19.381 --> 02:07:20.382
No.

02:07:20.549 --> 02:07:22.468
You've gotta keep
your skxawng ass here.

02:07:22.635 --> 02:07:23.677
He's outcast.

02:07:23.844 --> 02:07:25.596
There's nobody
to warn him but me.

02:07:25.763 --> 02:07:26.764
Bro,

02:07:27.806 --> 02:07:29.850
why do you always have
to make things so hard?

02:07:31.435 --> 02:07:32.478
No.

02:07:32.645 --> 02:07:35.230
You mean why can't I be
the perfect son like you?

02:07:36.607 --> 02:07:38.067
The perfect little soldier.

02:07:38.859 --> 02:07:40.110
Well, I'm not you!

02:07:40.778 --> 02:07:41.779
Okay?

02:07:42.279 --> 02:07:43.280
I'm not you.

02:07:44.448 --> 02:07:45.783
He's my brother.

02:07:45.949 --> 02:07:46.950
I'm going.

02:07:47.034 --> 02:07:48.535
Oh, he's your brother?

02:07:49.703 --> 02:07:51.622
No, I'm your brother.

02:07:51.789 --> 02:07:52.790
Lo'ak!

02:07:53.207 --> 02:07:54.291
Get off me.

02:07:55.501 --> 02:07:56.502
Lo'ak!

02:07:56.585 --> 02:07:57.836
-Come back!
-Come on.

02:07:57.920 --> 02:07:59.380
He's going to Payakan.

02:08:11.183 --> 02:08:12.309
Come back!

02:08:13.477 --> 02:08:14.937
There's Lo'ak! Lo'ak.

02:08:15.312 --> 02:08:16.355
Lo'ak!

02:08:16.522 --> 02:08:18.065
Lo'ak's going
to find Payakan!

02:08:18.357 --> 02:08:19.358
Wait up!

02:08:21.026 --> 02:08:22.027
Hold on!

02:08:31.120 --> 02:08:32.955
-All crews to stations.
-Sound general call.

02:08:33.038 --> 02:08:35.207
All right, people. Come on.
Let's make some money!

02:08:42.256 --> 02:08:44.007
Payakan!

02:08:44.091 --> 02:08:45.092
Brother!

02:08:45.509 --> 02:08:46.510
Lo'ak!

02:08:48.095 --> 02:08:49.096
Lo'ak!

02:08:49.179 --> 02:08:50.180
Wait!

02:08:53.267 --> 02:08:54.560
What is it?
What's wrong?

02:08:56.562 --> 02:08:57.604
Shit!

02:08:58.397 --> 02:09:00.315
Stay calm.
Stay calm.

02:09:01.066 --> 02:09:02.317
I got this.

02:09:07.781 --> 02:09:09.742
Shit!

02:09:12.453 --> 02:09:13.620
Lo'ak!

02:09:13.871 --> 02:09:15.038
Bro, come on!
Help me out!

02:09:15.789 --> 02:09:16.790
Hurry, the ship's coming!

02:09:16.874 --> 02:09:18.083
They're over there!

02:09:20.127 --> 02:09:21.378
Bro, come on!

02:09:21.628 --> 02:09:23.630
Bro.

02:09:23.797 --> 02:09:25.215
-Come on, bro.
-Hurry!

02:09:25.632 --> 02:09:26.675
Call it in!

02:09:26.925 --> 02:09:28.177
Call Dad!

02:09:28.260 --> 02:09:29.511
Call Dad!
Just go! Do it!

02:09:29.595 --> 02:09:31.430
-Just do it.
-Lo'ak, go! Hurry!

02:09:31.513 --> 02:09:33.432
Dad. I mean, Devil Dog.
Do you read me?

02:09:33.515 --> 02:09:34.683
Did you see
where they went?

02:09:34.767 --> 02:09:35.768
It's Eagle Eye,
do you copy?

02:09:35.851 --> 02:09:37.311
-They went outside the reef.
-Yeah, Lo'ak.

02:09:37.394 --> 02:09:38.812
Dad!

02:09:39.646 --> 02:09:41.940
We're with a tulkun
that's under attack.

02:09:42.107 --> 02:09:43.192
Killer ship's inbound.

02:09:43.358 --> 02:09:44.943
It's about two klicks out.

02:09:45.027 --> 02:09:46.028
Who's with you?

02:09:46.111 --> 02:09:47.112
It's all of us.

02:09:47.196 --> 02:09:48.238
Aonung and Tsireya too.

02:09:48.447 --> 02:09:49.823
We're at Three Brothers Rocks.

02:09:49.990 --> 02:09:51.867
You get to cover,
and you do not engage.

02:09:52.034 --> 02:09:53.035
All right? You hear me?

02:09:53.118 --> 02:09:54.203
Do not engage.
We're comin'.

02:09:54.286 --> 02:09:55.287
Yes, sir.

02:09:55.370 --> 02:09:56.413
It's getting closer!

02:09:56.497 --> 02:09:58.624
-- Three, two, pull!
-- Pull!

02:09:58.707 --> 02:10:01.001
Kids are under attack!

02:10:01.543 --> 02:10:03.462
The kids are under attack.
They were defending a tulkun.

02:10:03.629 --> 02:10:04.880
It's your kids too.

02:10:05.047 --> 02:10:06.089
The demon ship?

02:10:06.256 --> 02:10:07.549
Yes! We gotta go!

02:10:07.716 --> 02:10:09.259
Weapons.
Sound the alarm!

02:10:13.639 --> 02:10:14.723
You should stay back.

02:10:14.890 --> 02:10:15.933
I ride!

02:10:16.016 --> 02:10:17.017
Come!

02:11:06.358 --> 02:11:08.193
Sub teams, hatches close.

02:11:08.360 --> 02:11:09.820
Two-minute warning.

02:11:16.743 --> 02:11:17.744
Aonung!

02:11:18.745 --> 02:11:19.872
Hurry up! Come on!

02:11:19.955 --> 02:11:21.123
Bro, hurry up!

02:11:23.333 --> 02:11:24.334
Go, go, go!

02:11:28.505 --> 02:11:29.673
Pull! Now!

02:11:31.425 --> 02:11:33.343
-- Everybody! Together!
-- Pull!

02:11:37.180 --> 02:11:38.557
I'll be damned.

02:11:39.808 --> 02:11:41.018
Sully's kids.

02:11:41.476 --> 02:11:43.145
Let's roll.
Not you.

02:11:43.228 --> 02:11:44.688
Saddle up.

02:11:56.491 --> 02:11:58.118
Range is 700 meters.

02:11:58.285 --> 02:11:59.870
Pinger signal is good.

02:12:01.747 --> 02:12:03.123
Pull, harder!

02:12:03.290 --> 02:12:04.499
Pull!

02:12:04.750 --> 02:12:06.543
Pull, harder!

02:12:06.668 --> 02:12:07.669
Go!

02:12:08.170 --> 02:12:09.796
It's out!
Kiri, it's out!

02:12:09.922 --> 02:12:11.673
-- Go. Tuk, go.
-- Go, everybody!

02:12:11.757 --> 02:12:13.050
Come on.
Get out of here!

02:12:13.216 --> 02:12:14.968
Go that way!
I'll draw them off.

02:12:15.052 --> 02:12:16.428
-Okay.
-Lo'ak, come.

02:12:16.511 --> 02:12:18.013
Payakan.

02:12:18.096 --> 02:12:19.473
Go, go, dive!

02:12:19.640 --> 02:12:20.974
Now, dive!

02:12:21.058 --> 02:12:22.184
Grab on.

02:12:31.860 --> 02:12:32.945
Range 300.

02:12:33.111 --> 02:12:34.821
Ready depth charges,

02:12:34.988 --> 02:12:37.324
and fire, fire, fire.

02:12:43.080 --> 02:12:44.414
No depth charges.

02:12:44.748 --> 02:12:45.999
Scoresby, you copy?

02:12:46.083 --> 02:12:47.751
These kids
are worthless to me dead.

02:12:48.335 --> 02:12:49.753
Hold your fire.

02:12:54.341 --> 02:12:57.094
Circle out.
Get a cordon around 'em.

02:12:57.260 --> 02:12:58.595
Get your subs in the water.

02:12:59.513 --> 02:13:01.390
Sub teams, get wet.

02:13:50.981 --> 02:13:52.983
Crabs flank right.
Get around on 'em.

02:13:56.778 --> 02:13:58.071
Don't lose 'em.
Stay on 'em now.

02:13:58.572 --> 02:13:59.656
Planes up. We're goin' in!

02:13:59.823 --> 02:14:01.116
Oh, hell yeah!

02:14:32.939 --> 02:14:34.691
Tone on lock.
Two away.

02:15:04.137 --> 02:15:05.138
Where is Tuk?

02:15:05.222 --> 02:15:06.223
Did you see her?

02:15:22.906 --> 02:15:23.907
Tuk!

02:15:26.451 --> 02:15:27.452
Target in sight.

02:15:32.040 --> 02:15:33.250
It is coming.

02:15:33.416 --> 02:15:34.709
We gotta go!

02:15:51.101 --> 02:15:52.519
-Switch net.
-Switching.

02:15:52.602 --> 02:15:53.603
Fire.

02:16:12.414 --> 02:16:13.874
Hold on!

02:16:14.207 --> 02:16:15.750
Let me out!

02:16:16.126 --> 02:16:17.127
-Watch out!
-Tuk, move!

02:16:17.210 --> 02:16:18.211
Move your hand!
Move your hand!

02:16:18.295 --> 02:16:20.130
-Cut it!
-Hurry, hurry!

02:16:24.593 --> 02:16:26.178
Hey, kid,
get back here!

02:16:31.641 --> 02:16:32.642
Drop the weapon.

02:16:32.726 --> 02:16:33.727
-Put the weapon down!
-Put it down.

02:16:33.810 --> 02:16:34.853
Put it down!

02:16:35.687 --> 02:16:37.731
Stay down.

02:16:38.607 --> 02:16:39.900
Get him! Get him!

02:16:40.817 --> 02:16:41.985
Put the weapon down!

02:16:42.068 --> 02:16:43.486
Drop it, now!

02:16:43.612 --> 02:16:44.988
-Put it down!
-Drop the knife.

02:16:45.155 --> 02:16:46.656
Drop it.

02:16:46.740 --> 02:16:48.658
Hey! Hey,
what are you doing? Stop!

02:16:48.825 --> 02:16:49.951
Stop.
Don't hurt them.

02:16:51.286 --> 02:16:52.287
Stop moving.

02:16:52.370 --> 02:16:54.414
-Spider!
-Bro, you okay?

02:16:54.664 --> 02:16:56.166
Yeah. Great, cuz.

02:16:56.333 --> 02:16:57.459
-Never better.
-Down!

02:16:59.169 --> 02:17:00.170
Shut your mouth.

02:17:00.253 --> 02:17:01.254
Knock it off.
Stay still.

02:17:01.338 --> 02:17:02.672
Shut up. Quiet.

02:17:04.132 --> 02:17:05.133
Get back
to the bridge.

02:17:06.760 --> 02:17:07.761
Keep him there!

02:17:07.969 --> 02:17:09.387
I'm going,
I'm going.

02:17:10.513 --> 02:17:11.723
Yeah.

02:17:11.806 --> 02:17:12.974
I remember you.

02:17:14.142 --> 02:17:15.477
Cuff 'em to the rail.
All of 'em.

02:17:15.560 --> 02:17:16.561
Let's go.

02:17:16.770 --> 02:17:18.438
Let's go. Move!

02:17:18.521 --> 02:17:19.522
Over here.

02:17:19.606 --> 02:17:20.690
Watch 'em.
They bite.

02:17:21.858 --> 02:17:22.859
Get on your knees.
On 'em.

02:17:22.943 --> 02:17:23.944
Give me your hand.

02:17:24.027 --> 02:17:25.111
No!

02:17:26.279 --> 02:17:27.280
-Now the other.
-No.

02:17:31.660 --> 02:17:32.661
Be brave.

02:17:37.374 --> 02:17:38.416
Na'vi inbound!

02:17:40.919 --> 02:17:42.504
-Spread out. Weapons up.
-Dad!

02:17:42.587 --> 02:17:44.297
Push left.
Spread out.

02:17:46.716 --> 02:17:47.717
Stop.
Stop them.

02:17:51.888 --> 02:17:53.181
It's Sully.

02:17:55.475 --> 02:17:56.476
300 yards.

02:18:02.482 --> 02:18:03.817
They got our kids.

02:18:03.984 --> 02:18:05.360
Your daughter.

02:18:05.443 --> 02:18:06.444
Tuk. Lo'ak.

02:18:09.614 --> 02:18:12.784
Jake, tell your friends
to stand down.

02:18:13.910 --> 02:18:15.870
You want your kids back,

02:18:16.037 --> 02:18:17.580
you come out alone.

02:18:20.375 --> 02:18:22.502
You know better
than to test my resolve.

02:18:23.420 --> 02:18:24.921
Lo'ak! No!

02:18:26.881 --> 02:18:27.966
Fuck!

02:18:28.049 --> 02:18:30.010
I took you
under my wing, Jake.

02:18:30.552 --> 02:18:32.470
You betrayed me.

02:18:32.637 --> 02:18:34.014
You killed your own.

02:18:34.180 --> 02:18:36.016
Good men.
Good women.

02:18:36.182 --> 02:18:39.269
I will not hesitate
to execute your kid.

02:18:40.770 --> 02:18:41.771
Just wait one.

02:18:53.116 --> 02:18:54.242
Hold here.

02:18:55.243 --> 02:18:57.329
They are killers of tulkun.

02:18:57.746 --> 02:18:58.955
They must die.

02:18:59.122 --> 02:19:00.915
Here. Today.

02:19:01.082 --> 02:19:02.709
It's me that they want.

02:19:02.876 --> 02:19:04.377
That's what all this
has been about, all right?

02:19:04.544 --> 02:19:06.963
The hunting of our tulkun.
The taking of our kids.

02:19:10.091 --> 02:19:12.010
You brought this upon us!

02:19:12.469 --> 02:19:14.054
You!

02:19:17.390 --> 02:19:19.434
Well, then it's me
that has to do this.

02:19:25.398 --> 02:19:27.233
Offer's fixin' to expire.

02:19:27.400 --> 02:19:28.943
What's it gonna be?

02:19:29.694 --> 02:19:31.154
Check your fire.

02:19:31.321 --> 02:19:32.489
I'm comin' out.

02:19:43.583 --> 02:19:45.210
MaJake, what is happening?

02:19:46.127 --> 02:19:47.212
MaJake?

02:19:49.881 --> 02:19:52.592
Stay tense, everybody.
All weapons.

02:20:09.943 --> 02:20:11.528
Easy shot.

02:20:11.986 --> 02:20:14.197
You hit him now, they attack.

02:20:15.490 --> 02:20:17.450
Wait till he's on board.

02:20:44.269 --> 02:20:45.603
Payakan!

02:20:49.691 --> 02:20:50.692
No!

02:20:53.069 --> 02:20:54.070
Tuk!

02:20:56.823 --> 02:20:58.450
Open fire. Open fire!

02:21:00.869 --> 02:21:01.870
Brother!

02:21:06.624 --> 02:21:08.251
-Come about!
-Comin' about!

02:21:08.334 --> 02:21:09.669
Get me around!

02:21:09.961 --> 02:21:11.212
Get me a shot!

02:21:12.464 --> 02:21:14.257
Go, go!

02:21:16.634 --> 02:21:17.677
Look out!

02:21:20.680 --> 02:21:21.723
Hyah!

02:21:32.984 --> 02:21:34.110
Get me around!

02:21:34.194 --> 02:21:35.612
Go, go, go, go!

02:21:37.113 --> 02:21:38.114
Get in there,

02:21:38.281 --> 02:21:40.116
get me in range.
Go, go, go.

02:21:49.250 --> 02:21:50.293
Down!

02:21:53.338 --> 02:21:54.797
Bloody hell!

02:21:59.010 --> 02:22:01.429
Open fire! Open fire!

02:22:05.725 --> 02:22:06.935
Sully's inbound.

02:22:07.101 --> 02:22:08.311
I want eyes on!

02:22:08.603 --> 02:22:10.522
All right, let's go.
Saddle up. We're up!

02:22:52.480 --> 02:22:54.566
Somebody shoot something!

02:23:10.123 --> 02:23:11.124
Stop!

02:23:55.460 --> 02:23:56.544
Oh, shit!

02:24:06.721 --> 02:24:07.972
Get after them. Go!

02:24:25.198 --> 02:24:27.075
Breach!
Masks on!

02:24:27.450 --> 02:24:28.868
Masks on! Go!

02:24:55.895 --> 02:24:56.896
Switching feeds.

02:24:56.979 --> 02:24:58.314
What have we got?
What are we lookin' at?

02:25:00.274 --> 02:25:02.026
Hey!

02:25:06.322 --> 02:25:07.323
Hey! Get this guy!

02:25:08.616 --> 02:25:09.951
Get him out of here!

02:25:14.122 --> 02:25:15.957
Calm down!

02:25:19.043 --> 02:25:20.336
Pull! Pull!

02:25:30.221 --> 02:25:31.305
Go, go, go!

02:25:44.527 --> 02:25:46.154
Damage report!

02:25:46.320 --> 02:25:48.072
Flooding.
Compartment two and three.

02:25:48.656 --> 02:25:49.657
You okay?

02:26:19.103 --> 02:26:20.104
Port bow!

02:26:21.314 --> 02:26:23.149
Hard port!
Open fire!

02:26:24.233 --> 02:26:25.401
Get me a shot!

02:26:26.444 --> 02:26:27.445
Got ya!

02:26:45.004 --> 02:26:46.589
Cut us away!

02:26:46.756 --> 02:26:47.840
Not responding!

02:26:48.216 --> 02:26:50.009
Get us off the cable!

02:26:50.176 --> 02:26:52.053
Who's got the harpoon now?

02:26:56.516 --> 02:26:57.725
Back full!

02:27:09.278 --> 02:27:10.404
Reload!

02:27:13.741 --> 02:27:15.576
Not the cable, you idiot!

02:27:16.786 --> 02:27:17.995
We're dead
in the water.

02:27:19.330 --> 02:27:20.915
Taking on water. Pumps on.

02:27:21.707 --> 02:27:23.000
Man your weapons!

02:27:23.167 --> 02:27:25.002
I thought you were
the intelligent species here,

02:27:25.086 --> 02:27:27.213
-Scoresby.
-Shut ya cakehole, Garvin.

02:27:29.382 --> 02:27:30.591
Where are you?

02:27:31.259 --> 02:27:32.593
Cheeky bugger.

02:27:32.760 --> 02:27:34.679
You think you're
pretty clever, don't ya?

02:27:49.944 --> 02:27:51.028
Get down!

02:28:03.207 --> 02:28:04.208
Pumps aren't working.

02:28:04.292 --> 02:28:06.085
Abandon ship! Abandon ship!

02:28:06.294 --> 02:28:07.712
-Get him to a boat!
-Yes, sir.

02:28:07.795 --> 02:28:09.672
Let's go, people!
Let's move! Mask up!

02:28:15.136 --> 02:28:16.429
Neteyam!

02:28:16.971 --> 02:28:18.055
Hey, baby brother.

02:28:18.222 --> 02:28:19.307
Need some help?

02:28:19.807 --> 02:28:21.767
Shut up. Come on.
Get us loose.

02:28:23.978 --> 02:28:25.813
Okay,
get Tuk out of here.

02:28:25.897 --> 02:28:26.939
Bro, hurry up!

02:28:27.023 --> 02:28:28.733
Okay. Come on.

02:28:28.816 --> 02:28:30.860
Who's the Mighty Warrior?
Come on. Say it.

02:28:32.028 --> 02:28:33.321
-Bro!
-Come on. Let's go.

02:28:35.072 --> 02:28:36.616
Lo'ak!

02:28:37.033 --> 02:28:38.034
They've got Spider.

02:28:38.200 --> 02:28:39.911
We've gotta get him.
Come on.

02:28:40.286 --> 02:28:41.287
Come on, bro.

02:28:41.495 --> 02:28:42.705
We can't leave him.

02:28:50.796 --> 02:28:51.881
Let me go!

02:28:54.091 --> 02:28:55.301
No!

02:28:56.093 --> 02:28:57.386
No!

02:28:57.470 --> 02:28:58.554
Look!

02:29:05.144 --> 02:29:06.812
Let's go, buttercup.
Get up.

02:29:06.979 --> 02:29:09.148
I'm not your buttercup, perv!

02:29:09.315 --> 02:29:10.524
We've got to go back for her.

02:29:11.692 --> 02:29:12.693
Tuk, wait!

02:29:12.860 --> 02:29:14.946
Sullys stick together.

02:29:24.246 --> 02:29:25.748
All right,
we're a go for drop. Let's go.

02:29:26.123 --> 02:29:28.125
Wait right there,
guys. Wait. All right.

02:29:28.626 --> 02:29:29.710
Clear to drop!

02:29:31.128 --> 02:29:32.380
Check your mask.
Make sure it's tight.

02:29:32.546 --> 02:29:33.673
I'm good, dumbass.

02:29:36.842 --> 02:29:37.843
Move, move!

02:29:37.969 --> 02:29:40.137
Evacuating, people.
Come on. Let's go.

02:29:43.432 --> 02:29:45.977
Tuk, this is not a good idea.

02:29:46.102 --> 02:29:47.103
Tuk!

02:30:02.618 --> 02:30:03.619
Kiri.

02:30:04.078 --> 02:30:05.621
-Tuk!
-Shh.

02:30:07.206 --> 02:30:08.207
Cut it here.

02:30:09.542 --> 02:30:10.543
Come on.

02:30:10.626 --> 02:30:12.753
No!

02:30:18.467 --> 02:30:19.468
I got her.

02:30:26.142 --> 02:30:27.268
We can still get this done.

02:30:27.351 --> 02:30:28.394
Hell yeah.

02:30:28.477 --> 02:30:31.731
I can't believe
I'm tied up again!

02:30:31.856 --> 02:30:33.899
Hurry up, guys.

02:30:33.983 --> 02:30:36.152
You want
to go down with this ship?

02:30:57.965 --> 02:30:59.675
-Bro, come on.
-Let's go.

02:31:03.763 --> 02:31:04.764
Thanks, guys.

02:31:06.849 --> 02:31:08.267
-Go!
-No!

02:31:08.350 --> 02:31:09.477
-Bro, come on!
-Go, go, go!

02:31:10.728 --> 02:31:12.104
Go, go, go!

02:31:14.815 --> 02:31:15.816
Give me that!

02:31:19.862 --> 02:31:20.946
Go, go, go!

02:31:21.697 --> 02:31:22.698
This way.

02:31:30.247 --> 02:31:31.248
Cover, cover!

02:31:37.338 --> 02:31:38.339

02:31:50.434 --> 02:31:52.228
-That was insane, cuz.
-Yeah.

02:31:52.311 --> 02:31:53.521
Whoo-hoo!

02:31:57.233 --> 02:31:58.234

02:31:58.317 --> 02:31:59.318
Come on, bro!

Come on.

02:32:18.129 --> 02:32:19.380
-Grab him.
-Bro, I got him.

02:32:21.048 --> 02:32:22.049
Holy shit.

02:32:22.216 --> 02:32:23.592
Hold him up!

02:32:25.845 --> 02:32:27.471
Bro, come on.

02:32:27.555 --> 02:32:28.889
It's okay, bro. I got you.

02:32:29.056 --> 02:32:30.141
Hurry. Go, go, go!

02:32:31.183 --> 02:32:32.518
They have Kiri and Tuk.

02:32:33.894 --> 02:32:34.895
I can't go back.

02:32:42.278 --> 02:32:44.238
Dad!

02:32:44.321 --> 02:32:45.865
Dad, help! It's Neteyam!

02:32:45.948 --> 02:32:47.074
Hurry!

02:32:47.158 --> 02:32:48.492
Here! Take him.

02:32:50.411 --> 02:32:52.163
-Oh, no.
-It's Neteyam! He's hurt!

02:32:52.329 --> 02:32:53.622
-Jake.
-Come on. Come on!

02:32:53.706 --> 02:32:54.748
Hurry, please!

02:32:55.499 --> 02:32:56.500
Pull!

02:32:59.003 --> 02:33:00.254
Bro, watch his head.
Watch his head.

02:33:00.337 --> 02:33:01.589
Pull!

02:33:02.047 --> 02:33:03.048
Come on!

02:33:06.385 --> 02:33:08.220
Just watch his head.

02:33:08.304 --> 02:33:09.305
Okay.

02:33:09.722 --> 02:33:10.723
It's okay, bro.

02:33:10.806 --> 02:33:11.932
We got you.

02:33:12.016 --> 02:33:13.017
Oh, no.

02:33:15.186 --> 02:33:16.270
Put pressure.

02:33:16.353 --> 02:33:17.354
Put pressure on it.

02:33:19.190 --> 02:33:20.191
Dad, I...

02:33:20.274 --> 02:33:21.358
It's okay.
I'm here.

02:33:23.694 --> 02:33:25.154
-No, no, no, no, no.
-It's okay. I'm here.

02:33:25.237 --> 02:33:26.322
-It's okay, son. I gotcha.
-No...

02:33:28.782 --> 02:33:29.783
It's okay.

02:33:32.244 --> 02:33:34.163
I want to go home.

02:33:36.081 --> 02:33:37.208
I know. I know.

02:33:37.291 --> 02:33:38.292
It's okay, we're goin' home.

02:33:39.001 --> 02:33:40.085
We're goin' home.

02:33:41.921 --> 02:33:42.922
We're goin' home.

02:33:43.547 --> 02:33:44.798
It's okay. It's okay.

02:33:44.965 --> 02:33:45.966
Dad, I...

02:33:53.057 --> 02:33:54.058
Neteyam...

02:33:59.271 --> 02:34:03.275
No. No, no, no.
Neteyam!

02:34:08.072 --> 02:34:10.574
Neteyam.

02:34:10.991 --> 02:34:12.493
Oh, Great Mother.

02:34:12.576 --> 02:34:13.744
No, Great Mother.

02:34:14.286 --> 02:34:16.163
Please.

02:34:17.748 --> 02:34:19.208
Oh, my son.

02:34:19.750 --> 02:34:20.834
My son.

02:34:20.918 --> 02:34:21.919
No!

02:34:27.841 --> 02:34:29.343
My son!

02:34:32.846 --> 02:34:34.265
No!

02:34:36.016 --> 02:34:37.601
No!

02:34:38.269 --> 02:34:40.396
Can you hear me, Corporal?

02:34:40.479 --> 02:34:42.564
No, no, no.

02:34:42.648 --> 02:34:45.359
Yeah, yeah,
I think you can.

02:34:46.318 --> 02:34:47.569
I got your daughters.

02:34:50.281 --> 02:34:51.699
Same deal as before.

02:34:53.325 --> 02:34:54.326
You for them.

02:34:55.536 --> 02:34:57.288
No!

02:34:59.665 --> 02:35:01.125
Where are your sisters?

02:35:03.085 --> 02:35:04.586
Your sisters.
Where are they?

02:35:05.504 --> 02:35:06.505
I don't know.

02:35:06.588 --> 02:35:07.923
-Where are they?
-They're on the ship.

02:35:08.007 --> 02:35:09.800
They're tied up on the ship.

02:35:09.967 --> 02:35:11.176
They're...
They're at the moon pool.

02:35:11.802 --> 02:35:13.887
At... At the well deck.
Midships.

02:35:13.971 --> 02:35:15.306
What?

02:35:15.389 --> 02:35:16.557
Come on. I'll show you.

02:35:17.016 --> 02:35:18.017
Come on.

02:35:18.100 --> 02:35:19.143
-I'll show you.
-Talk to me,

02:35:19.226 --> 02:35:20.227
Corporal.

02:35:20.394 --> 02:35:21.979
-Z, up top.
-I need somethin', Jake,

02:35:22.062 --> 02:35:23.647
or there's gonna
be consequences.

02:35:24.648 --> 02:35:26.692
Yeah, I hear you.

02:35:26.775 --> 02:35:27.776
-Come on.
-Come on!

02:35:27.860 --> 02:35:29.403
Let's go. We gotta go.

02:35:29.486 --> 02:35:30.487
Come on, let's go.

02:35:30.571 --> 02:35:31.905
-- No!
-- Let's go.

02:35:32.072 --> 02:35:34.825
-Listen. Listen. Listen to me.
-No...

02:35:36.702 --> 02:35:37.703
Listen to me.

02:35:37.870 --> 02:35:39.997
Listen to me. Listen to me.
They have our daughters.

02:35:40.164 --> 02:35:41.415
They have our daughters.

02:35:44.668 --> 02:35:46.879
I need you with me.

02:35:48.088 --> 02:35:49.631
And I need you to be strong.

02:35:50.174 --> 02:35:51.592
Right now.

02:35:51.759 --> 02:35:52.968
Strong heart.

02:35:54.386 --> 02:35:55.637
Strong heart.

02:36:02.853 --> 02:36:03.854
Yeah.

02:36:09.276 --> 02:36:10.611
Let's go get our daughters.

02:36:25.584 --> 02:36:27.086
You stay with your brother.

02:36:27.628 --> 02:36:29.046
Dad, I want to go with you.

02:36:32.049 --> 02:36:33.050
You've done enough.

02:36:33.717 --> 02:36:35.260
Dad...

02:36:39.056 --> 02:36:40.057
Hold fire.

02:36:41.350 --> 02:36:42.351
Let's go.

02:36:43.394 --> 02:36:44.395
He's coming.

02:36:46.188 --> 02:36:47.189
I'm good. Go, go!

02:36:49.650 --> 02:36:50.776
Let's get this guy.

02:36:50.901 --> 02:36:52.111
It's what we came here for.

02:36:57.324 --> 02:36:58.325
Stay with him.

02:36:58.867 --> 02:36:59.952
No...

02:37:00.786 --> 02:37:02.121
Heads on a swivel, guys.

02:37:23.517 --> 02:37:24.518
Go.

02:37:32.568 --> 02:37:33.569
Where are they?

02:37:33.652 --> 02:37:35.529
The middle deck.
Where they launch the subs.

02:37:35.696 --> 02:37:37.114
There's, like,
a pool in the center.

02:37:38.073 --> 02:37:39.199
They're at
the forward railing.

02:37:41.785 --> 02:37:42.786
No, no.
Stay here.

02:37:45.956 --> 02:37:47.207
Talk to me, Corporal.

02:37:48.083 --> 02:37:49.168
This ship's going down

02:37:49.334 --> 02:37:50.502
and your girls with it.

02:37:52.254 --> 02:37:53.839
Your boy didn't have to die.

02:37:54.256 --> 02:37:55.924
You brought that on yourself.

02:38:03.098 --> 02:38:04.850
You thought you could keep
your family safe,

02:38:04.933 --> 02:38:05.934
but you can't.

02:38:08.312 --> 02:38:10.022
Only one way
to keep them safe.

02:38:13.901 --> 02:38:16.695
So let's get this over with
before you lose another kid.

02:38:28.707 --> 02:38:30.334
Get down!

02:39:11.917 --> 02:39:12.918
Who's down?

02:39:13.001 --> 02:39:14.586
-Zdinarsik, you copy?
-Sound off!

02:39:14.670 --> 02:39:16.338
Clear!

02:39:16.713 --> 02:39:18.090
Prager. You read?

02:39:20.092 --> 02:39:21.134
Eyes up. Eyes up!

02:39:30.394 --> 02:39:31.395
Move up!

02:39:33.939 --> 02:39:34.940
Push left. Go!

02:39:35.649 --> 02:39:36.817
Push right. Get around on her.

02:39:37.276 --> 02:39:38.318
Who's got eyes?

02:39:58.672 --> 02:39:59.673
Move!

02:40:22.404 --> 02:40:24.406
MaJake.

02:40:31.079 --> 02:40:32.289
It's Mom!

02:40:38.670 --> 02:40:39.796
That's right.

02:40:40.172 --> 02:40:42.090
They're coming for you.

02:41:32.933 --> 02:41:33.975
Dad! Dad.

02:41:36.978 --> 02:41:38.397
Okay. Where's your sister?

02:41:38.480 --> 02:41:39.481
Where is she?
Where is she?

02:41:39.564 --> 02:41:40.982
That way.
That way.

02:41:41.441 --> 02:41:42.442
Okay, stay behind me.

02:41:47.781 --> 02:41:49.908
Kiri!

02:41:49.991 --> 02:41:51.493
Runnin' out
of time here, Corporal.

02:41:53.245 --> 02:41:54.830
You already lost
one kid today.

02:41:54.913 --> 02:41:56.206
You really wanna lose another?

02:41:56.289 --> 02:41:58.417
Do not test me!

02:42:00.210 --> 02:42:01.837
Just kill him, Dad!

02:42:02.546 --> 02:42:03.547
Kiri.

02:42:04.506 --> 02:42:05.590
Weapons down.

02:42:05.674 --> 02:42:06.967
Don't. Don't do it.

02:42:07.050 --> 02:42:08.051
Down!

02:42:10.303 --> 02:42:11.304
Kick 'em away.

02:42:13.515 --> 02:42:14.516
Do it!

02:42:17.394 --> 02:42:18.437
No.

02:42:20.230 --> 02:42:21.314
Cuff yourself.

02:42:21.398 --> 02:42:22.858
No! No, don't hurt her, okay?

02:42:22.983 --> 02:42:24.151
-Don't...
-Stand there!

02:42:24.693 --> 02:42:26.445
-Don't!
-Don't move!

02:42:26.528 --> 02:42:27.529
Not a step.

02:42:28.155 --> 02:42:29.865
Cuffs on. Now.

02:42:30.073 --> 02:42:32.117
You son of a bitch.

02:42:32.284 --> 02:42:33.785
Please,
don't hurt her.

02:42:36.997 --> 02:42:38.206
Release.

02:42:39.166 --> 02:42:40.167
Or I cut.

02:42:42.753 --> 02:42:44.880
What, you think I care
about some kid?

02:42:46.214 --> 02:42:47.215
He's not mine.

02:42:48.049 --> 02:42:49.843
We're not even
the same species.

02:42:50.635 --> 02:42:52.053
Just please don't...

02:42:52.137 --> 02:42:53.138
don't hurt her.

02:42:53.221 --> 02:42:54.681
Just please let her go.

02:42:54.848 --> 02:42:55.932
-Don't.
-Please!

02:42:56.016 --> 02:42:57.642
-- Don't kill him.
-- Listen to me!

02:42:57.726 --> 02:42:59.186
Let her go. Don't hurt her.

02:42:59.436 --> 02:43:00.937
Mom, don't kill him.

02:43:01.605 --> 02:43:03.899
A son for a son.

02:43:06.109 --> 02:43:07.360
Please don't hurt her.

02:43:09.529 --> 02:43:10.739
I cut.

02:43:11.072 --> 02:43:12.741
Please just let her go, okay?

02:43:12.824 --> 02:43:13.867
Just let her go.

02:43:15.243 --> 02:43:16.870
No!

02:43:26.087 --> 02:43:28.423
Kiri... Kiri. Kiri.

02:43:35.263 --> 02:43:36.264
Spider.

02:43:37.140 --> 02:43:38.975
Spider, get 'em out of here.

02:43:39.351 --> 02:43:40.352
Come on.

02:43:40.435 --> 02:43:41.436
Guys. Tuk.

02:43:41.561 --> 02:43:43.313
I owe you a death.

02:43:44.564 --> 02:43:45.565
Mom.

02:43:45.649 --> 02:43:46.650
-Mama.
-Come.

02:43:46.733 --> 02:43:47.734
Come on.

02:43:47.818 --> 02:43:49.736
Please, Mama.

02:43:49.820 --> 02:43:51.321
You're not leaving,
are you, Jake?

02:43:51.404 --> 02:43:53.156
-It's okay.
-Knowin' I'm out there.

02:43:54.407 --> 02:43:56.493
Knowin' that I'll never stop.

02:43:56.868 --> 02:43:58.161
I'm coming for you.

02:43:58.245 --> 02:44:01.039
And when I do,
I'll kill your whole family.

02:44:02.082 --> 02:44:03.083
Dad...

02:44:05.126 --> 02:44:06.127
Then let's get it done.

02:44:16.888 --> 02:44:18.765
Jake!

02:44:21.726 --> 02:44:23.270
-It's coming!
-Back. Back.

02:44:23.436 --> 02:44:24.646
Get back to the ship. Go!

02:44:24.729 --> 02:44:25.814
Tuk, swim, swim.

02:44:28.608 --> 02:44:29.734
-Stay close.
-Come on.

02:44:29.818 --> 02:44:31.111
-Keep moving. Go, go, go!
-Stay close.

02:44:31.194 --> 02:44:33.321
Tuk. Tuk

02:44:33.405 --> 02:44:34.406
Tuk!

02:44:35.156 --> 02:44:36.575
-Grab her!
-Mom, take my hand!

02:44:36.658 --> 02:44:37.659
-- Hold on!
-- Hold on!

02:44:37.951 --> 02:44:39.369
Tuk!

02:44:40.787 --> 02:44:42.247
Mom!

02:44:42.330 --> 02:44:43.456
No!

02:44:43.540 --> 02:44:44.583
-Kiri, come on. Kiri...
-No...

02:44:44.666 --> 02:44:46.167
-...we've got to go, come on.
-No!

02:44:47.627 --> 02:44:48.920
Tuk!

02:44:49.462 --> 02:44:50.922
Go!
Climb. Climb!

02:44:51.381 --> 02:44:52.924
Kiri, come on!

02:44:53.550 --> 02:44:54.551
Come on,
let's go!

02:44:54.634 --> 02:44:56.803
-Mom!
-Swim! Swim.

02:44:56.887 --> 02:44:57.888
Go, Tuk.

02:44:57.971 --> 02:44:58.972
Climb up.

02:45:06.313 --> 02:45:07.314
-Mom...
-Run!

02:45:07.939 --> 02:45:09.107
Go!

02:45:09.649 --> 02:45:10.650
Go, go, go!

02:45:18.116 --> 02:45:19.284
Keep climbing! Go!

02:45:23.830 --> 02:45:24.831
I got you.

02:45:27.000 --> 02:45:28.793
Give me your hand!
Come on!

02:45:29.002 --> 02:45:31.171
Okay... Tuk!

02:45:31.421 --> 02:45:32.756
Open it!

02:45:40.347 --> 02:45:41.514
Open it!

02:45:41.598 --> 02:45:42.933
Move back. Move back.

02:45:43.642 --> 02:45:44.643
Come.

02:45:46.144 --> 02:45:47.270
Tuk!

02:45:56.947 --> 02:45:57.948
Climb!

02:45:58.490 --> 02:45:59.491
Come on.

02:46:01.242 --> 02:46:02.243
Climb!

02:46:02.327 --> 02:46:03.328
Go!

02:46:03.662 --> 02:46:04.663
Go up!

02:46:10.210 --> 02:46:11.503
We're rolling over!

02:46:11.878 --> 02:46:13.338
-Go, go, go, go!
-Okay...

02:46:15.340 --> 02:46:16.675
No!

02:46:16.758 --> 02:46:18.885
-Mom!
-Tuk.

02:46:26.309 --> 02:46:27.686
Kiri!

02:46:27.769 --> 02:46:28.812
Keep going!

02:46:32.232 --> 02:46:33.233
This way,
this way!

02:46:33.400 --> 02:46:34.401
Okay.

02:46:34.567 --> 02:46:35.568
Go!

02:46:39.322 --> 02:46:41.324
Open it! Open it!

02:46:43.284 --> 02:46:44.369
Mom!

02:46:47.414 --> 02:46:48.415
Come on!

02:46:57.966 --> 02:47:00.176
Go, Tuk!

02:47:01.052 --> 02:47:02.053
There's no way out!

02:47:04.347 --> 02:47:05.432
Stay together,
okay?

02:47:05.598 --> 02:47:06.975
-Yes.
-Stay together.

02:47:07.142 --> 02:47:08.476
Yes.

02:47:37.088 --> 02:47:38.256
Oh, Great Mother!

02:47:38.339 --> 02:47:39.799
Oh, Great Mother, help us!

02:48:22.342 --> 02:48:23.635
Kiri!

02:48:44.197 --> 02:48:45.198
Bro!

02:48:45.782 --> 02:48:47.534
Mom and Dad
are down there.

02:48:47.659 --> 02:48:49.494
-In the ship.
-Grab on.

02:48:50.286 --> 02:48:51.287
Bro, I'm good. Go!

02:49:19.023 --> 02:49:20.024
Okay.

02:49:47.844 --> 02:49:48.845
Jake!

02:50:25.048 --> 02:50:26.257
Dad.

02:50:31.054 --> 02:50:32.430
Fuck!

02:50:47.195 --> 02:50:48.947
Come on, you son of a bitch!

02:50:49.155 --> 02:50:50.156
Dad, just breathe.

02:50:50.240 --> 02:50:51.282
Neteyam?

02:50:51.908 --> 02:50:52.909
No, Dad.
It's Lo'ak.

02:50:54.327 --> 02:50:55.328
Oh, Lo'ak.

02:50:56.663 --> 02:50:57.664
I'm sorry, sir.

02:50:58.122 --> 02:50:59.958
I'm sorry about Neteyam.
It's all my fault.

02:51:00.041 --> 02:51:01.042
Just focus.

02:51:01.167 --> 02:51:02.252
Focus on now.

02:51:21.521 --> 02:51:22.647
We're losing
the air pocket.

02:51:22.814 --> 02:51:23.815
Come on.
We've gotta move.

02:51:23.982 --> 02:51:25.066
Come on, Dad.

02:51:32.782 --> 02:51:34.325
You know your way out?

02:51:34.742 --> 02:51:37.453
I think so. But, Dad, it's
gonna be a long breath-hold.

02:51:37.620 --> 02:51:39.163
I can't make it.

02:51:39.706 --> 02:51:41.833
-You can. You can.
-No.

02:51:41.916 --> 02:51:43.001
-So you gotta go right now.
-No.

02:51:43.501 --> 02:51:45.044
I can't lose you too, Dad.

02:51:45.211 --> 02:51:46.212
Please.

02:51:50.383 --> 02:51:51.968
Mama,
I'm scared.

02:51:53.469 --> 02:51:54.470
It is all right.

02:51:55.305 --> 02:51:56.306
Stay close to me.

02:51:56.389 --> 02:51:58.349
Stay close to Mama.

02:52:00.935 --> 02:52:01.936
It's okay.

02:52:18.619 --> 02:52:20.455
You just have to
slow your heart down.

02:52:20.913 --> 02:52:22.081
Be real calm.

02:52:23.416 --> 02:52:24.667
Breathe from here.

02:52:24.834 --> 02:52:26.419
Hey, breathe from here.

02:52:39.891 --> 02:52:42.685
The way of water
has no beginning and no end.

02:52:45.438 --> 02:52:47.482
The sea is around you
and in you.

02:52:49.108 --> 02:52:50.360
The sea is your home

02:52:50.443 --> 02:52:52.779
before your birth
and after your death.

02:52:57.992 --> 02:53:00.870
The sea gives
and the sea takes.

02:53:02.121 --> 02:53:04.165
Water connects all things.

02:53:06.334 --> 02:53:07.835
Life to death.

02:53:09.712 --> 02:53:11.964
Darkness to light.

02:53:35.071 --> 02:53:36.239
-Hi.
-Kiri!

02:53:36.322 --> 02:53:37.323
Kiri.

02:53:37.407 --> 02:53:39.409
Everything's going to be
all right, little sister.

02:53:39.617 --> 02:53:40.618
Mom,

02:53:40.701 --> 02:53:42.078
I'm gonna
give this to you.

02:53:47.125 --> 02:53:48.126
It'll help you.

02:53:49.502 --> 02:53:50.503
Dad, you can do this.

02:53:52.380 --> 02:53:53.673
-Trust me.
-Yeah.

02:53:54.132 --> 02:53:55.133
Calm your heart.

02:53:57.552 --> 02:53:58.636
Big breaths.

02:54:02.557 --> 02:54:04.225
Last breath.

02:54:08.229 --> 02:54:09.605
Follow me.

02:55:25.932 --> 02:55:27.183
Hold on.

02:55:27.308 --> 02:55:28.309
Just breathe.

02:55:28.893 --> 02:55:31.103
Just breathe.

02:55:34.273 --> 02:55:35.274
Thank you.

02:55:44.325 --> 02:55:45.701
I See you,

02:55:45.785 --> 02:55:46.786
son.

02:55:49.455 --> 02:55:50.456
MaJake!

02:55:51.624 --> 02:55:52.833
-Dad!
-Mom!

02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:54.210
Dad. Dad.

02:55:55.711 --> 02:55:56.712
Come on.

02:55:57.463 --> 02:55:58.798
-Come here.
-Tuk.

02:55:58.881 --> 02:56:00.091
-I got you.
-Here.

02:56:06.430 --> 02:56:07.431
Brother.

02:56:16.857 --> 02:56:18.776
Sullys stick together.

02:56:21.112 --> 02:56:22.655
It was our greatest weakness

02:56:24.031 --> 02:56:25.491
and our great strength.

02:56:27.493 --> 02:56:29.245
Thank you,
Great Mother.

02:56:29.954 --> 02:56:30.955
Thank you.

02:57:10.286 --> 02:57:11.287
Let's move out.

02:57:17.918 --> 02:57:18.919
Son.

02:57:21.172 --> 02:57:22.173
Come with me.

02:57:26.927 --> 02:57:28.763
Spider!

02:58:02.254 --> 02:58:03.255
Monkey Boy!

02:58:07.843 --> 02:58:09.053
Spider.

02:58:16.394 --> 02:58:17.561
-You all right?
-Yeah.

02:58:21.774 --> 02:58:22.775
Come here.

02:58:25.778 --> 02:58:27.947
A son for a son.

02:58:44.714 --> 02:58:46.966
Every songcord
must have a last bead.

02:59:12.158 --> 02:59:13.993
A father protects.

02:59:15.286 --> 02:59:16.787
It's what gives him meaning.

02:59:45.191 --> 02:59:47.651
The People say that
all energy is only borrowed.

02:59:50.488 --> 02:59:52.364
And one day
you have to give it back.

03:00:06.212 --> 03:00:09.507
Eywa holds
all her children in her heart.

03:00:11.467 --> 03:00:12.760
Nothing is ever lost.

03:00:16.096 --> 03:00:17.097
Neteyam!

03:00:17.723 --> 03:00:18.933
Neteyam!

03:00:38.953 --> 03:00:40.204
My family and I,

03:00:41.372 --> 03:00:42.414
we'll move on tomorrow.

03:00:43.165 --> 03:00:44.291
Far away from here.

03:00:45.709 --> 03:00:47.545
Your son lies
with our ancestors.

03:00:48.712 --> 03:00:51.382
You are Metkayina now.

03:00:57.054 --> 03:00:58.514
And there it was.

03:01:00.474 --> 03:01:01.934
We are Sea People now.

03:01:04.478 --> 03:01:06.397
This is our home.

03:02:06.957 --> 03:02:07.958
Dad!

03:02:08.834 --> 03:02:09.835
Look what I caught!

03:02:10.628 --> 03:02:11.629
Wow.

03:02:12.922 --> 03:02:13.964
Oh, that's a big one.

03:02:14.632 --> 03:02:16.300
He was in that pool.

03:02:16.425 --> 03:02:18.260
By the rocks.

03:02:19.261 --> 03:02:20.512
Right where you said.

03:02:24.391 --> 03:02:25.517
What is it, Dad?

03:02:27.061 --> 03:02:28.062
Why are you crying?

03:02:30.356 --> 03:02:32.942
I'm just happy
to see you, boy.

03:02:34.568 --> 03:02:36.403
I'm happy to see you, too.

03:02:38.781 --> 03:02:40.157
Here.
You try.

03:02:42.660 --> 03:02:43.661
Okay.

03:02:45.412 --> 03:02:46.747
Leave any for me?

03:02:46.914 --> 03:02:49.333
Uh, maybe.

03:02:54.588 --> 03:02:56.340
Yeah! Check that out. See?

03:03:03.764 --> 03:03:05.057
I see now.

03:03:06.141 --> 03:03:08.143
I can't save my family
by running.

03:03:09.395 --> 03:03:10.437
This is our home.

03:03:11.438 --> 03:03:13.023
This is our fortress.

03:03:14.316 --> 03:03:16.402
This is where
we make our stand.
