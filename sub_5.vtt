03:23.161 --> 03:26.122
When I first met your father...

03:26.206 --> 03:27.790
...I was trying to kill him.

03:27.874 --> 03:29.959
It was love at first sight.

04:14.629 --> 04:17.131
He belongs with his own kind.

04:21.511 --> 04:22.595
It's mine!

04:22.679 --> 04:23.972
I had it first.

04:24.055 --> 04:25.848
Why should I let you have it?

04:28.393 --> 04:31.980
Lo'ak you liar! Let me have it!

08:54.951 --> 08:58.913
ONE YEAR LATER

17:07.860 --> 17:10.988
HIGH CAMP, OMATIKAYA STRONGHOLD

22:34.644 --> 22:37.356
BRIDGEHEAD CITY

32:03.463 --> 32:04.797
Put it down. Put it down.

32:17.936 --> 32:18.937
Be calm...

33:09.654 --> 33:11.614
Sorry, I don't speak your language...

33:12.615 --> 33:14.200
...to buttholes.

33:14.909 --> 33:16.411
Where is your father?

50:19.433 --> 50:22.644
AWA'ATLU, A METKAYINA VILLAGE

59:37.740 --> 59:39.492
Swim together with us.

01:00:13.985 --> 01:00:15.612
What's wrong with them?

01:00:16.654 --> 01:00:18.323
Those guys are bad divers.

01:00:18.406 --> 01:00:19.616
Stop.

01:00:20.158 --> 01:00:21.618
They're learning.

01:02:15.815 --> 01:02:20.653
And that starts with
speaking the language.

01:02:23.906 --> 01:02:25.992
You call that speaking the language?

01:02:26.325 --> 01:02:28.411
You sound like a three year old!

01:10:54.917 --> 01:10:58.087
It gives breath under water.

01:16:19.825 --> 01:16:24.121
THREE BROTHERS ROCKS

01:16:51.064 --> 01:16:52.649
Call the fish.

01:17:08.707 --> 01:17:10.083
What a moron!

01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:32.942
I'm sorry.

01:30:35.555 --> 01:30:38.349
It's too painful.

01:31:36.407 --> 01:31:38.034
Go faster!

01:42:22.511 --> 01:42:25.139
Sister, I See you.

01:42:26.181 --> 01:42:28.767
I See you, Sister. I am happy.

01:42:34.439 --> 01:42:37.943
Your son is beautiful.

01:42:38.443 --> 01:42:41.363
Thank you. How is your baby?

01:42:42.239 --> 01:42:44.825
My baby is strong.

01:42:47.202 --> 01:42:48.745
I met a boy.

01:43:15.856 --> 01:43:19.026
TA'UNUI VILLAGE

01:43:38.045 --> 01:43:39.171
This man...

01:43:39.755 --> 01:43:43.050
We know he is in these islands.

01:43:43.592 --> 01:43:44.843
Here? This village?

01:43:45.219 --> 01:43:47.888
We are a totally separate clan...

01:43:47.971 --> 01:43:49.806
...this man in the reflection...

01:43:49.890 --> 01:43:51.475
...is from the forest.

01:44:03.570 --> 01:44:05.697
He needs to leave here...

01:44:05.781 --> 01:44:07.658
and go to the forest to find this man.

01:44:29.554 --> 01:44:30.806
Be calm.

01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:34.476
Be calm!

01:44:43.527 --> 01:44:44.861
He told you he doesn't know!

01:45:45.881 --> 01:45:47.424
I'm sorry!

01:45:47.507 --> 01:45:49.343
I didn't know!

01:45:49.801 --> 01:45:51.428
Stop this madness!
